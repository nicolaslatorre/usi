1624395,"Removing Array Elements in Python while keeping track of their position I'v got two numpy arrays. The first array contains some zeros (which are distributed randomly over the length of the array) which I would like to remove. My issue is that I would also like to remove the entries of the second array at the index positions where the first array elements are zero. I only came up with a very cumbersome for-loop. Does anyone have an ""elegant"" method for doing this? Thx! You can use boolean indexing. x!=0 gives you a boolean array with True where x!=0 false where x==0. If you index either x or y with this array (ie x_nozeros=x[x!=0]) then you will get only the elements where x!=0. eg: In [1]: import numpy as np In [2]: x = np.array([120304]) In [3]: y = np.arange(17) In [4]: indx = x!=0 In [5]: x_nozeros = x[indx] In [6]: y_nozeros = y[indx] In [7]: x_nozeros Out[7]: array([1 2 3 4]) In [8]: y_nozeros Out[8]: array([1 2 4 6])  Is it what you want? I am a NumPy newbie. In [1]: import numpy as np In [2]: a = np.array([120304]) In [3]: b = np.array([123456]) In [4]: b[np.where(a)] Out[4]: array([1 2 4 6]) In [5]: np.where(a) Out[5]: (array([0 1 3 5])) In [6]: a[np.where(a)] Out[6]: array([1 2 3 4]) That's exactly what I looked for thanks! @AFoglia thanks for the introduction of np.extract. it's really cool. @Dzz Glad it helped :) This is the way I usually do it but there is an even simpler method. `np.extract(ab)`.

299495,"How to add an image to a JPanel? I have a JPanel to which I'd like to add JPEG and PNG images that I generate on the fly. All the examples I've seen so far in the Swing Tutorials specially in the Swing examples use ImageIcons. I'm generating these images as byte arrays and they are usually larger than the common icon they use in the examples at 640x480. Is there any (performance or other) problem in using the ImageIcon class to display an image that size in a JPanel? What's the usual way of doing it? How to add an image to a JPanel without using the ImageIcon class? Edit: A more careful examination of the tutorials and the API shows that you cannot add an ImageIcon directly to a JPanel. Instead they achieve the same effect by setting the image as an icon of a JLabel. This just doesn't feel right... I'm doing something very similar in a private project I'm working on. Thus far I've generated images up to 1024x1024 without any problems (except memory) and can display them very quickly and without any performance problems. Overriding the paint method of JPanel subclass is overkill and requires more work than you need to do. The way I do it is: Class MapIcon implements Icon {...} OR Class MapIcon extends ImageIcon {...} The code you use to generate the image will be in this class. I use a BufferedImage to draw onto then when the paintIcon() is called use g.drawImvge(bufferedImage); This reduces the amount of flashing done while you generate your images and you can thread it. Next I extend JLabel: Class MapLabel extends Scrollable MouseMotionListener {...} This is because I want to put my image on a scroll pane I.e. display part of the image and have the user scroll around as needed. So then I use a JScrollPane to hold the MapLabel which contains only the MapIcon. MapIcon map = new MapIcon (); MapLabel mapLabel = new MapLabel (map); JScrollPane scrollPane = new JScrollPane(); scrollPane.getViewport ().add (mapLabel); But for your scenario (just show the whole image every time). You need to add the MapLabel to the top JPanel and make sure to size them all to the full size of the image (by overriding the GetPreferredSize()).  JLabel imgLabel = new JLabel(new ImageIcon(""path_to_image.png""));  You can avoid rolling your own Component subclass completely by using the JXImagePanel class from the free SwingX libraries. Download  I think there is no need to subclass of anything. Just use a Jlabel. You can set an image into a Jlabel. So resize the Jlabel then fill it with an image. Its OK. This is the way I do. Simpler by a long shot.  If you are using JPanels then are probably working with Swing. Try this: BufferedImage myPicture = ImageIO.read(new File(""path-to-file"")); JLabel picLabel = new JLabel(new ImageIcon(myPicture)); add(picLabel); The image is now a swing component. It becomes subject to layout conditions like any other component. +1 Excellent code. +1 that. clean. Nice just used that code myself. +1. Nice one.. Just used this code.. +1 how to scale the image according to the size of the JLabel? Nice code! I'm not much experienced with Swing but I can't get it work. Does anybody tried it in jdk 1.6.0_16? @ATorras I know you asked this a while back but if any other newbies had my issues remember to picLabel.setBounds();  JPanel is almost always the wrong class to subclass. Why wouldn't you subclass JComponent? There is a slight problem with ImageIcon in that the constructor blocks reading the image. Not really a problem when loading from the application jar but maybe if you're potentially reading over a network connection. There's plenty of AWT-era examples of using MediaTracker ImageObserver and friends even in the JDK demos.  There shouldn't be any problem (other than any general problems you might have with very large images). If you're talking about adding multiple images to a single panel I would use ImageIcons. For a single image I would think about making a custom subclass of JPanel and overriding its paintComponent method to draw the image. (see 2)  Fred Haslam's way works fine. I had trouble with the filepath though since I want to reference an image within my jar. To do this I used: BufferedImage wPic = ImageIO.read(this.getClass().getResource(""snow.png"")); JLabel wIcon = new JLabel(new ImageIcon(wPic)); Since I only have a finite number (about 10) images that I need to load using this method it works quite well. It gets file without having to have the correct relative filepath.  Here's how I do it (with a little more info on how to load an image): import java.awt.Graphics; import java.awt.image.BufferedImage; import java.io.File; import java.io.IOException; import java.util.logging.Level; import java.util.logging.Logger; import javax.imageio.ImageIO; import javax.swing.JPanel; public class ImagePanel extends JPanel{ private BufferedImage image; public ImagePanel() { try { image = ImageIO.read(new File(""image name and path"")); } catch (IOException ex) { // handle exception... } } @Override protected void paintComponent(Graphics g) { super.paintComponent(g); g.drawImage(image 0 0 null); // see javadoc for more info on the parameters } } Opps... put the example together a little to quick... @Dutow - Good call I edited the answer. Thanks. I tried using this with some custom buttons on top and found that there were strange redrawing issues. Fred Haslam's answer below did not suffer from this problem. -1 for invalid implementation of paintComponent (@Dogmatixed most probably that's why you are having those redrawing issues) - it _must_ garantee to cover its complete area if it reports being opaque (which is the default) easiest achieved by calling super.paintComponent @kleopatra Thanks I didn't realize that... according to the javadoc: ""Further if you do not invoker super's implementation you must honor the opaque property that is if this component is opaque you must completely fill in the background in a non-opaque color. If you do not honor the opaque property you will likely see visual artifacts."" I'll update the answer now. thanks for the edit reverted my vote :-) Please always respect the `Principle of Encapsulation` while overriding methods of the Super Class the Access Specifier of the `paintComponent(...)` method is `protected` and not `public` :-) How do you handle errors in this implementation? I mean if an error is thrown in the constructor not only will you have to deal not just with that but you'll also have to deal with `NullPointerException`s that paintComponent() will throw (and will throw as many times as it is called). Wait nevermind. `drawImage()` doesn't throw a NPE when `img` is null.  You can subclass JPanel - here is an extract from my ImagePanel which puts an image in any one of 5 locations top/left top/right middle/middle bottom/left or bottom/right: protected void paintComponent(Graphics gc) { super.paintComponent(gc); Dimension cs=getSize(); // component size gc=gc.create(); gc.clipRect(insets.leftinsets.top(cs.width-insets.left-insets.right)(cs.height-insets.top-insets.bottom)); if(mmImage!=null) { gc.drawImage(mmImage(((cs.width-mmSize.width)/2) +mmHrzShift)(((cs.height-mmSize.height)/2) +mmVrtShift)null); } if(tlImage!=null) { gc.drawImage(tlImage(insets.left +tlHrzShift)(insets.top +tlVrtShift)null); } if(trImage!=null) { gc.drawImage(trImage(cs.width-insets.right-trSize.width+trHrzShift)(insets.top +trVrtShift)null); } if(blImage!=null) { gc.drawImage(blImage(insets.left +blHrzShift)(cs.height-insets.bottom-blSize.height+blVrtShift)null); } if(brImage!=null) { gc.drawImage(brImage(cs.width-insets.right-brSize.width+brHrzShift)(cs.height-insets.bottom-brSize.height+brVrtShift)null); } }",java image swing jpanel,0.1799600894717954,0.8197437023249882,1.560595988072366E-4,1.401486044091912E-4
2908884,Thoughts/Input about Database Design for a CMS I'm just about to expand the functionality of our own CMS but was thinking of restructuring the database to make it simpler to add/edit data types and values. Currently the CMS is quite flat - the CMS requires a field in the database for every type of stored value (manually created). The first option that comes to mind is simply a table which keeps the data types (ie: Address 1 Suburb Email Address etc) and another table which holds values for each of these data types. Just like how Wordpress keeps values in the 'options' table PHP serialize would be used to store an array of values. The second option is how Drupal works the CMS creates tables for every data type. Unlike Wordpress this can be a bit of an overkill but really useful for SQL queries when ordering and grouping by a particular value. What's everyone's thoughts? I'm talking about CMS through the whole question. The main question I'm asking is what's the best method of how the database should be structured? Wordpress Vs Drupal Method of structuring the database. Are you talking about a CMS (content management system) or a CRM (customer relationship management) product? It sounds like you are confusing the two. I think My Lively wants to know what you mean by CMS. See here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMS for the possibilities. In my opinion you should avoid serialization where possible. Your relational database should be relational and thus be structured as such. This would include the 'Drupal Method' e.g. one table per data type. This also keeps your database healthy in a sense that it can be indexed en easily queried upon. Very good point I have already adopted the process of creating tables on the fly for the different data types. This has produced a much better system.  Unless you plan to have lots of different data types that will be added in the future which are unknown now this is not really going to help you and would be overkill. If you have very wide tables and lots of holes in your data (i.e. lots of columns that seem to be NULL at random) then that is a pattern that is screaming to maybe have a seperate table for data that may only belong to certain entries. Keep it simple and logical. Don't abstract for the sake of abstraction. Indeed storing integers is cheaper with regards to storage space but unless that is a problem then don't do it in this case. Hi Lloyd after careful consideration with all of our clients the best approach was to create a new table for each data type (blog photo testimonial). We have a master table which keeps record of the structure and we create/amend tables on the fly based on this structure. We tested each scenario with 10 million rows in the database and speed is our biggest consideration. Selecting inserting updating and deleting table rows was much faster and efficient compared to a segmented database with a table full of keys and another table full of values. A good solution: clean separation simple and logical.

138793,"How do I add a separator to a JComboBox in Java? I have a JComboBox and would like to have a separator in the list of elements. How do I do this in Java? A sample scenario where this would come in handy is when making a combobox for font-family-selection; similar to the font-family-selection-control in Word and Excel. In this case I would like to show the most-used-fonts at the top then a separator and finally all font-families below the separator in alphabetical order. Can anyone help me with how to do this or is this not possible in Java? By the time I wrote and tested the code below you probably got lot of better answers... I don't mind as I enjoyed the experiment/learning (still a bit green on the Swing front). [EDIT] Three years later I am a bit less green and I took in account the valid remarks of bobndrew. I have no problem with the key navigation that just works (perhaps it was a JVM version issue?). I improved the renderer to show highlight though. And I use a better demo code. The accepted answer is probably better (more standard) mine is probably more flexible if you want a custom separator... The base idea is to use a renderer for the items of the combo box.

I first used K&R style when I read their C book years ago then I chose to align braces for better readability (for me question of taste) and never came back (except on projects requiring them of course). @bobndrew: hey! As I wrote I was a newbie at the time (3 years already!). Among sins you don't point out I probably used some Swing test template I found and even worse I didn't use SwingUtilities.invokeLater! The code I have currently uses it at least (but it is still a JFrame subclass...). And m_lastRecentIndex is more local... But most of your criticism is about a quickly made test class which isn't really production code. Today I pay more attention to such code as newbies can take inspiration from it... :-) Also you are right about highlighting hovered elements and selection. TODO Your variable-naming is not the worst thing here: You're breaking the whole combobox-item-selection: the selection is not painted anymore and the first-letter-key-jumps are broken. And you should define `m_combo` and `m_renderer` in the smallest possible scope (in `public TestGui()`). And should not use a glooooobal `m_lastRecentIndex` for the Renderer **and** the 'TestGui' class (which should be a lonely Main class not a 'JFrame' subclass). But I like the braces-style! Note: I edited the code above for a more modern / correct version. One advantage of my approach is that it is more flexible (in look at least) than JSeparator and it doesn't take a slot.  You can use a custom ListCellRenderer which would draw the separator items differently. See docs and a small tutorial.  There is a pretty short tutorial with an example that shows how to use a custom ListCellRenderer on java2s http://www.java2s.com/Code/Java/Swing-Components/BlockComboBoxExample.htm Basically it involves inserting a known placeholder in your list model and when you detect the placeholder in the ListCellRenderer you return an instance of 'new JSeparator(JSeparator.HORIZONTAL)' The `BlockComboBoxExample` example breaks the cursor-key and the first-letter-key navigation.

1721802,What is the equivalent of MATLAB's repmat in NumPy I would like to execute the equivalent of the following MATLAB code using NumPy: repmat([1; 1] [1 1 1]). How would I accomplish this? Note that some of the reasons you'd need to use MATLAB's repmat are taken care of by NumPy's broadcasting mechanism which allows you to do various types of math with arrays of similar shape. So if you had say a 1600x1400x3 array representing a 3-color image you could (elementwise) multiply it by [1.0 0.25 0.25] to reduce the amount of green and blue at each pixel. See the above link for more information. thank kwatford :)  Here is a much better (official) NumPy for Matlab Users link - I'm afraid the mathesaurus one is quite out of date. The numpy equivalent of repmat(a m n) is tile(a (m n)). This works with multiple dimensions and gives a similar result to matlab. (Numpy gives a 3d output array as you would expect - matlab for some reason gives 2d output - but the content is the same). Matlab: >> repmat([1;1][111]) ans = 1 1 Python: In [46]: a = np.array([[1][1]]) In [47]: np.tile(a [111]) Out[47]: array([[[1] [1]]]) when i try size(repmat([1;1][112])) it get ans = 2 1 2 [in matlab] but in python np.tile(a[112]).shape it get(1 2 2)  i want numpy give result as same as matlab np.tile(a[:np.newaxis][112]) - it gives the same. Problem is tile promotes `a` to the dimension of the tile argument by *prepending* new axes as necessary. Matlab seems to work the other way. Similarly with 4d tiling you will need newaxis twice... so `np.tile(a[:newaxisnewaxis][1234]) = size(repmat(a[1 2 3 4]))` as required...  See NumPy for Matlab users. Matlab: repmat(a 2 3) Numpy: numpy.kron(numpy.ones((23)) a) I don't think the mathesaurus link is very good.

1782114,Why don't these two math functions return the same result? I'm trying to use fancy indexing instead of looping to speed up a function in Numpy. To the best of my knowledge I've implemented the fancy indexing version correctly. The problem is that the two functions (loop and fancy-indexed) do not return the same result. I'm not sure why. It's worth pointing out that the functions do return the same result if a smaller array is used (e.g. 20 x 20 x 20). Below I've included everything necessary to reproduce the error. If the functions do return the same result then the line find_maxdiff(data) - find_maxdiff_fancy(data) should return an array full of zeroes. from numpy import * def rms(data axis=0): return sqrt(mean(data ** 2 axis)) def find_maxdiff(data): samples channels epochs = shape(data) window_size = 50 maxdiff = zeros(epochs) for epoch in xrange(epochs): signal = rms(data[: : epoch] axis=1) for t in xrange(window_size alen(signal) - window_size): amp_a = mean(signal[t-window_size:t] axis=0) amp_b = mean(signal[t:t+window_size] axis=0) the_diff = abs(amp_b - amp_a) if the_diff > maxdiff[epoch]: maxdiff[epoch] = the_diff return maxdiff def find_maxdiff_fancy(data): samples channels epochs = shape(data) window_size = 50 maxdiff = zeros(epochs) signal = rms(data axis=1) for t in xrange(window_size alen(signal) - window_size): amp_a = mean(signal[t-window_size:t] axis=0) amp_b = mean(signal[t:t+window_size] axis=0) the_diff = abs(amp_b - amp_a) maxdiff[the_diff > maxdiff] = the_diff return maxdiff data = random.random((600 20 100)) find_maxdiff(data) - find_maxdiff_fancy(data) data = random.random((20 20 20)) find_maxdiff(data) - find_maxdiff_fancy(data) What magnitude of difference is there between the two? This isn't the typical floating point accuracy issue that catches so many people out is it? At what value between 20x20x20 and 600x20x100 do things start to go wrong? Do things go wrong gradually and more and more or all at once? The magnitude of the differences is rather large to just be floating point errors. First in fancy your signal is now 2D if I understand correctly - so I think it would be clearer to index it explicitly (eg amp_a = mean(signal[t-window_size:t:] axis=0). Similarly with alen(signal) - this should just be samples in both cases so I think it would be clearer to use that. It is wrong whenever you are actually doing something in the t loop - when samples < window_lenght as in the 20x20x20 example that loop never gets executed. As soon as that loop is executed more than once (ie samples > 2 *window_length+1) then the errors come. Not sure why though - they do look equivalent to me.  The problem is this line: maxdiff[the_diff > maxdiff] = the_diff The left side selects only some elements of maxdiff but the right side contains all elements of the_diff. This should work instead: replaceElements = the_diff > maxdiff maxdiff[replaceElements] = the_diff[replaceElements] or simply: maxdiff = maximum(maxdiff the_diff) As for why 20x20x20 size seems to work: This is because your window size is too large so nothing gets executed. Thanks for helping me better understand how fancy assignment works. Also I should have caught the silly reason why the smaller array was working :) Thanks again.,python numpy scipy,2.37270081275033E-4,0.04381076990133719,3.307479932971072E-4,0.9556212120240906

The issue here is that whenever a new classified is posted (and inserted into mysql database) I need to first review it manually. My question is is there anyway to tell mysql that ""this record is inactive so don't return it""? I know of one way offcourse to add a column named ""state"" and change it to ""active"" for all classifieds which I want active. But is there any other method built into mysql which does the same? In other words I dont want the record returned when users search the website if the record isn't ""reviewed"" first by me. EDIT: I know of the WHERE clause that is not my Q here. Is there any other method built into phpMyAdmin? Thanks No there is no built-in method. Beside of methods mentioned above you could try using views to filter inactive records. Instead of: SELECT * FROM table WHERE status = 'active'; use a view: CREATE VIEW only_active AS SELECT * FROM table WHERE status = 'active'; and then just SELECT * FROM only_active That makes you sure that you will never get inactive records incidentally.  Have a reviewed column in the table of type BOOLEAN. Initialize it to false and update to true once a listing has been reviewed. Whenever you get the list of classifieds for the site include reviewed=true in the WHERE clause. There is no way built into phpMyAdmin.  There really isn't a way to achieve this without having some sort of DB field that tells you which records you've reviewed and which you haven't. So the only sensible answer you're going to get is ""add a state field"". The question really is why you don't want to do it that way? (especially if you already know how to do it). If you can answer that you may get some useful help help with solving the problems you perceive the obvious answer may cause you.  On a row level there are no properties other then ones you specify yourself. So the answer is definitively no. Using views as Piotr described might be useful to you; especially if you reverse the situation and rename the original table create a view in it's name that will return only 'reviewed' records This way the solution might be transparent to your application. Few notes: The database does not care if myphpadmin or any other client/application is looking at the data all clients are essentially equal; so the implication is that what you ask can not be possible (otherwise how would this hiding mechanism determine if it should display the rows or hide them?). There is a semi exception though - RDBMS that support row-level security could do this (but effectively such system store additional attribute per row) EDIT: Forgot to link http://www.sqlmaestro.com/resources/all/row_level_security_mysql/ This gives some examples and details.  I know of the WHERE clause that is not my Q here. Is there any other method built into phpMyAdmin? no it's not. your should realy use a ""state"" column to get what you want. Using a new column 'state' or 'reviewed' will also give you more flexibility in the future. You'll be able to alter the column state to inactive at a later date (eg programmatically when the classified expires after a certain date) or maybe if the ad causes problems in any form you can quickly disable it.  If you are using the ORM Doctrine you can use the SoftDelete behavior which does exactly the thing you want. You can build query's and the ""SoftDeleted"" records do not return. You should be using Doctrine for it though. If you can not go with Doctrine I would use Piotr Pankowski's solution. The only thing is that I would use a DateTime field and not an Boolean field. Set the field to the current DateTime when it's added and NULL when it's not disabled.",php sql mysql html database,2.743312288262845E-4,4.4738312300784033E-4,0.9989348639122939,3.4342173587184247E-4
1727950,"Just Curious about Python+Numpy to Realtime Gesture Recognition i 'm just finish labs meeting with my advisor previous code is written in matlab and it run offline mode not realtime mode so i decide to convert to python+numpy (in offline version) but after labs meeting my advisor raise issue about speed of realtime recognition so i have doubt about speed of python+numpy to do this project. or better in c? my project is about using electronic glove (2x sensors) to get realtime data and do data processing recognition process ohh don't know about accepting answers thankfor that :) What size arrays (N) are you dealing with? I've found for some problems the speed advantage of numpy over pure python only become recognizable when N > 10000 or so. In fact pure python can be faster than numpy when dealing with small arrays since there is a performance hit associated with importing numpy and creating the arrays. NumPy is very fast if you follow some basic rules. You should avoid Python loops using the operators provided by NumPy instead whenever you can. This and this should be a good starting points. After reading through that why don't you write some simple code in both Matlab and NumPy and compare the performance? If it performs well in NumPy it should be enough to convince your advisor especially if the code is representative of the actual algorithms you are using in your project. Note: you should also see that your algorithm really is suited for realtime recognition.  You might look at OpenCV which has Python libs ctypes-opencv and opencv-cython; I haven't used these myself. Ideally you want to combine a fast-running C inner loop with a flexible Python/Numpy play-with-algorithms. Bytheway google ""opencv gesture recognition"" ��� 6680 hits.  I think the answer depends on three things: how well you code in Matlab how well you code in Python/Numpy and your algorithm. Both Matlab and Python can be fast for number crunching if you're diligent about vectorizing everything and using library calls. If your Matlab code is already very good I would be surprised if you saw much performance benefit moving to Numpy unless there's some specific idiom you can use to your advantage. You might not even see a large benefit moving to C. I this case your effort would likely be better spent tuning your algorithm. If your Matlab code isn't so good you could 1) write better Matlab code 2) rewrite in good Numpy code or 3) rewrite in C.",python c numpy gesture-recognition,3.662793334074111E-4,5.97333350541741E-4,5.105833565685681E-4,0.9985258039594822

1734626,"Each looping return a result I am a beginner and got an issue really head around now. Here is the code: n=3 #time step #f v and r are arrayseg [345] #rvf all have initial array which is when n=0 def force(): r=position() f=r*2 return f def position(n): v=velocity(n) for i in range(n): #This part may wrong... r=v*i #How can I return results when i=01...5? return r def velocity(n): f=force for i in range(n): v=f*i #Same problem here..... return v Another problem is force. It is a function of position which is a function of velocity and velocity is a function of force. So it's kind of a logic loop. I can't even start. Physically it should initially start from force at time=0 then carrying on looping. But I just don't know how to do it in Python. Also how can I make the row of rv to be the results with the evolution of the time? You can use yield.  def velocity(n): f=force for i in range(n): v=f*i yield(v)  for vel in velocity(n): //do something One working example. It will print the output of function test as soon as it yields. So you do not need to wait for the next iteration of the loop.  import time def test(): for i in range(10): time.sleep(i) yield(i)  for k in test(): print k thanks for replayhowever i dont quite understand whats does yield do? +1 for using generators. A much under valued/used feature in my opinion. I have changed to yieldhowever it gives '''' when I call the function..it seems is a mistake..also how can I make these three functions run?they messed together how to start?thanks what exactly you are trying to achieve and what are you initial inputs? sorry about the confusing i made. The initial input is just n(timestep)and i want is the code gives two arraysone for r one for vwhich the rows of them are correspond to i=0123...n this code is trying to simulate gravity force between 2 stars.Thanks for helping AFAIK your code says: force depends on position position depends on velocity and velocity depends on force. So there is no start position you are stuck in a circle. Or may be try to clarify the problem statement. Or is this some sort of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation? there is start positionvrf all have initial arrays(when n=0).then it should calculate f(n=1) then use this to update v(n=0) to v(n=1)then use v(n=1) update r(n=0) to r(n=1)then use r(n=1) update f(n=1) to f(n=2)....and so on until finish n.  You need to use append to add to the list. def position(n): v=velocity(n) r = array() for i in range(n): #this part may wrong... r.append(v*i) #how can I return results when i=01...5? return r thanks for replay yesi am going to use appendbut it doesnt really solve the question seems..  You could use a list comprehension: def position(n): v=velocity(n) return [v*i for i in range(n)] Or since you are using numpy: v=np.array([123]) # array([1 2 3]) you can use numpy broadcasting to express the entire calculation in one blow: i=np.arange(5) # array([0 1 2 3 4]) v[:]*i[:np.newaxis] # array([[ 0 0 0] # [ 1 2 3] # [ 2 4 6] # [ 3 6 9] # [ 4 8 12]]) In the above calculation the scalar values in i (e.g. 01234) are each multiplied against the array v. The results are collected in a 2-d numpy array. Each row corresponds to a different value of i. See http://www.scipy.org/EricsBroadcastingDoc for an introduction to numpy broadcasting. @OP: To address your question regarding a ""logic loop"": Typically what you do is define a ""state"" of the system. Perhaps in your case a state would consist of a tuple (timepositionvelocity). You would then define a function which is given a state-tuple as an input and return a new state-tuple as output. Given a (timepositionvelocity) the force could be computed (mainly from the old position). From the force you then compute the new velocity. From the velocity you compute a new position. Don't write code first. In this case sit down with paper and pencil and grind out the calculation by hand with a concrete example. Do enough iterations until you see clearly the pattern of how the calculation is done. What is the order of the steps? What parts get repeated? Once you see how to do it by hand it will be much clearer how to write the python code. thanks for replaybut i do need use array unluckly.. thanks alotit helps! however still left a bit of question see my functions relationship..really messhow can i sort it out?thanks again I've added a bit of advice on how to resolve the ""logic loop"". thanks alotwhat you have said is exactly the same as my tutor said which is really important and i think i have already know clearly about the physicsjust dont know how to translate to python code to add a bit more: there is start positionvrf all have initial arrays(when n=0).then it should calculate f(n=1) then use this to update v(n=0) to v(n=1)then use v(n=1) update r(n=0) to r(n=1)then use r(n=1) update f(n=1) to f(n=2)....and so on until finish n.  It looks like you're trying to do an Euler algorithm and getting a bit mixed up in the looping. Here's how I think it should look (and I'll assume this is for a game and not homework... if it is for homework you should state that clearly so we don't give the full answer like I'm doing here.) This example is for a ball on a spring which I think you're aiming for. I'm the example my initial conditions are to thrown diagonally along the x-z axis and I've also included gravity (if you didn't intend to you vectors you can just replace all the vector quantities with scalars e.g. t x v = 0. 0. 2.; etc). from numpy import * # set the start conditions etc. n_timesteps = 100 dt m k = .1 1. 2. # timestep mass spring-const (I'll write the equations correctly so the units make sense) t x v = 0. array([0.0.0.]) array([2. 0. 2.]) # initial values gravity = array([0. 0. -9.8]) # to make the problem a little more interesting result = zeros((4 n_timesteps)) # run the simulation looping through the timesteps for n in range(n_timesteps): # do the calculation f = -k*x + gravity a = f/m v += a*dt x += v*dt # store the results t += dt # just for easy record keeping result[0n] = t result[1:4 n] = x Note that for loop is looping over the timesteps (and the all looping over the vectors is handles by numpy broadcasting e.g. f = -k*x+gravity what could be easier?). Also note that the force is set first and then we work our way down the chain of integrating the derivatives then go back to the top and start at the force again. (You're right that this is a bit asymmetric and really we should update them all at the same time or something like that and this is a deficiency of the Euler method but it works well enough for small timesteps.) Here's what the plots look like... the ball oscillates as expected Edit: To clarify your question: Basically your code's issue is not a question of ""starting the functions"" as you imply; instead your code is approaching the problem in the wrong way so you need to fix the approach. It looks like you're trying to iterate your timesteps within each function. This is incorrect! Instead you need to do an enveloping iteration through the timesteps and for each timestep update the current state of each variable used in the calculation at that timestep. You can write this update as a separate function or for example you can do it inline like I did. But it makes no sense to iterate the timesteps within each variable calculation function. Instead for your example to make sense force velocity and other functions should have as inputs things at the present timestep and return an update to the state of that variable to be used in the next timestep. See how my example does this: it just cycles through the timesteps and within each timestep cycle it sequentially updates all the variables basing each updated variable on the variables that were updated just before it in this current timestep.

When I try to delete the package alltogether like this: $query=""DELETE a b FROM classified as a $sql_table as b WHERE a.ad_id = '$id' AND a.classified_id = b.classified_id AND a.poster_password='$pass'""; b MUST be deleted first I guess. Even in PhpMyAdmin I cant delete a if b is still there so I delete b first. But what decides the order in which comes first? The tables are alla InnoDB. What should I do? Thanks The reason the reference key is the way it is is because I use JOIN when I display my records... Just so you know. The MySQL manual says about multi-table DELETE and foreign keys: If you use a multiple-table DELETE statement involving InnoDB tables for which there are foreign key constraints the MySQL optimizer might process tables in an order that differs from that of their parent/child relationship. In this case the statement fails and rolls back. Instead you should delete from a single table and rely on the ON DELETE capabilities that InnoDB provides to cause the other tables to be modified accordingly. So that when a record in your main table is deleted so are its foreign references e.g: ALTER TABLE products ADD CONSTRAINT fk_supplier FOREIGN KEY (supplier_id supplier_name) REFERENCES supplier(supplier_id supplier_name) ON DELETE CASCADE;  Your Delete syntax is invalid. You need to do this in two statements (unless as nuqqsa mentioned you have CASCADE DELETE enabled on the relationship between table a and table b): Delete From b Where Exists ( Select 1 From a Where a.poster_password = '$pass' And a.ad_id = '$id' And a.classified_id = b.classified_id ) Delete From a Where a.poster_password = '$pass' And a.ad_id = '$id' What decides which comes first is the foreign keys relationships. Whichever table is the parent table must be deleted from last. You are a SQL server user I'm guessing? @simplemotives - Me? I am however the equivalent of the above syntax should work in any database product. @Thomas - Your SQL style is all I was commenting on. @simplemotives - Np.

Thomas: Check this Q out I am having trouble getting your code above to work: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2972796/sql-syntax-error-little-help-please @Camran - MySql apparently requires that you use the `From` keyword in your Delete statements and I've updated my post to reflect that.

How would I search these how is the logic made up? I think I need examples of queries from PHP (SELECT etc) Say you want to search for a CAR -> year=2010 fuel=PETROL how is the query then?

176150,"Swing: Is there a way to differentiate between a user-caused ItemEvent and an application-caused one? I'm working with a combobox in a Swing-based application and I'm having a hard time figuring out what to do to differentiate between an ItemEvent that is generated from a user event vs one caused by the application. For instance Lets say I have a combobox 'combo' and I'm listening for itemStateChanged events with my ItemListener 'listener'. When either a user changes the selection to item 2 or I execute the line (pseudocode): combo.setSelection(2) .. it seems like I'm not able to tell these events apart. That said I'm no Swing expert by any means so I thought I would ask. Thanks! @awied: you also need to worry about the situation in which a user accessibility application is driving your program. I'm not following this. Why would you generate events programmatically and then want them to be different from normal events? I'm not generating events exactly. I have listeners that ""do things"" which are attached to the combobox. When the user performs the action the application works properly. However when I need to update the combo it still causes the events but I need it handled differently. You can set a flag in your code before you set the selection and then check for this flag in the listener (and unset the flag if it is set)... There may be a better way since Java 6 but this is the way I always used to do it... [Edit]: As David points out you will need to set the flag (and update the combo) in the EDT using SwingUtilities.invokeLater or similar (you should do this anyway as you are changing a UI control)  So I'm guessing you want the user selection to perform some action rather than just a plain old direct state change. This is an issue caused by limited flexibility (flexibility is always going to be limited particularly if you have flexibility in other directions). My suggestion: Firstly always go straight to using model in Swing. The widgets are way to complicated and you want different concerns to be split up. Fortunately Swing is already there with its models. A common pattern is to have delegation between models. So in this case you have the ""real"" default model that holds your data. Insert between the JComboBox and real ComboBoxModel and delegating ComboBoxModel that performs actions on state change instructions. Your application code should ignore the JComboBox and go straight for the real ComboBoxModel bypassing the delegating model. So in a diagram:  User -- JComboBox -- ActionComboBoxModel -- DefaultComboBoxModel -- Application code  Whether the user selects Item 2 or the API calls setSelection(2) the event will appear the same. The solution to your problem might be in re-thinking what you want the itemStateChanged code to do when the selection changes. Why would your app work differently under each condition? Maybe there are similarities that you can use to your advantage. Be careful when using flags. The itemStateChanged event will occur on the Event Dispatch Thread which is a different thread than the one on which you'd set the state of the flag. This would mean that using a flag may not be 100% reliable.  If you need to tell the events apart then there is probably something about your design that needs a rethink. The whole point of MVC is to decouple changes to the model from the actual mouse clicks of the user. Perhaps you should restate the question in terms of why you would ever want to differentiate between these two situations. We could then provide some guidance on a different way of achieving the goal.  The Action and Reaction law is quite clear :). If you try to react on change there is no need to distinguish between user and application. I can imagine only one use case where you need to ""distinguish"". The case where application is displaying some data. In this case you have probably data model for your application. And also there are some change listener in this model and application GUI will react by setting values to components. And also. If user selects anything into GUI component. The data model will react by changing value. In this case it is easy to set up some sort of read-only state on data model which will notify model to ignore ANY event coming from observed objects. This notification set should run in EDT and there is no problem with flagging. Small example: class ApplicationDataModel { private Flag current = Flag.RW; public void setData(ApplicationData data) { current = Flag.RO; setDataImpl(data); notifyObservers(); current = Flag.RW; } public void reaction(Event e) { if (flag = Flag.RO) return; ... } } Be careful with flagging and don't forget about threading. If you are calling setData from another thread then EDT you are going into trouble. Of course. The extraction of ApplicationData object has to be run in different thread ;). In general rethink design of your application.",java swing events combobox listeners,2.108230449372263E-4,0.9992313764333411,2.9388154915725056E-4,2.6391897256428104E-4

1208118,"Using numpy to build an array of all combinations of two arrays I'm trying to run over the parameters space of a 6 parameter function to study it's numerical behavior before trying to do anything complex with it so I'm searching for a efficient way to do this. My function takes float values given a 6-dim numpy array as input. What I tried to do initially was this: 1) First I created a function that takes 2 arrays and generate an array with all combinations of values from the two arrays from numpy import * def comb(ab): c = [] for i in a: for j in b: c.append(r_[ij]) return c The I used reduce to apply that to m copies of the same array: def combs(am): return reduce(comb[a]*m) And then I evaluate my function like this: values = combs(np.arange(010.1)6) for val in values: print F(val) This works but it's waaaay too slow. I know the space of parameters is huge but this shouldn't be so slow. I have only sampled (10)^6 = a million points in this example and it took more then 15 seconds just to create the array 'values'. Do you know any more efficient way of doing this with numpy? I can modify the way the function F take it's arguments if it's necessary. itertools.combinations is in general the fastest way to get combinations from a Python container (if you do in fact want combinations i.e. arrangements WITHOUT repetitions and independent of order; that's not what your code appears to be doing but I can't tell whether that's because your code is buggy or because you're using the wrong terminology). If you want something different than combinations perhaps other iterators in itertools product or permutations might serve you better. For example it looks like your code is roughly the same as: for val in itertools.product(np.arange(0 1 0.1) repeat=6): print F(val) All of these iterators yield tuples not lists or numpy arrays so if your F is picky about getting specifically a numpy array you'll have to accept the extra overhead of constructing or clearing and re-filling one at each step. Thanks. This is exactly what I needed. I'm still not used to some python concepts like iterators. @Rafael glad to know I've been of help!  It looks like you want a grid to evaluate your function in which case you can use numpy.ogrid (open) or numpy.mgrid (fleshed out): import numpy my_grid = numpy.mgrid[[slice(010.1)]*6]  You can do something like this import numpy as np def cartesian_coord(*arrays): grid = np.meshgrid(*arrays) coord_list = [entry.ravel() for entry in grid] points = np.vstack(coord_list).T return points a = np.arange(4) # fake data print(cartesian_coord(*6*[a]) which gives array([[0 0 0 0 0 0] [0 0 0 0 0 1] [0 0 0 0 0 2] ... [3 3 3 3 3 1] [3 3 3 3 3 2] [3 3 3 3 3 3]])  The following numpy implementation should be approx. 2x the speed of the given answer: def cartesian2(arrays): arrays = [np.asarray(a) for a in arrays] shape = (len(x) for x in arrays) ix = np.indices(shape dtype=int) ix = ix.reshape(len(arrays) -1).T for n arr in enumerate(arrays): ix[: n] = arrays[n][ix[: n]] return ix  Here's a pure-numpy implementation.

2755967,"Adjusting sql statement in a function based upon input Hey there This is a bit urgent! I'm trying to make a simple filter search where-by you can choose from a series of 3 drop downs and then based upon this the results are then displayed How would I go about adjusting the sql query for each and if you were to only choose to search from aone of the 3 rather than all 3 etc... example there could be the url with input such as: url.com?location=gb&color=3&hair=4 and still form the correct sql query for something like this: url.com?location=gb&hair=1 and not encounter problems with WHERE and AND etc etc and empty variables in the statement Would this not need to be a massive function to check using if to see how the data is set for all possibilities? Thanks Stefan I answered a question the other day that I think is pretty similar to yours: PHP: prepared statement IF statement help needed The idea is that you use conditional logic in your code to collect terms as needed corresponding to your application inputs. Then you join them together in such a way that produces the right SQL expression. It does need some application function to build the SQL expression dynamically and there are techniques to make it as concise as possible. If you really have many possible search terms you might end up with a lengthy function. But guess what? If you have complex inputs it should be no surprise that you need complex code to deal with them. Re your comment: url.com?location=gb&color=3&hair=4 Okay you have up to three inputs and you have to dynamically build up an SQL query from these. Let's start from the end and work backwards. Ultimately you want an SQL expression like this: WHERE (location = 'gb') AND (color = 3) AND (hair = 4) If you have an array of three terms you can join them together in PHP using the implode() function. But you may also have fewer than three. You can handle any number of terms by putting however many terms you have into an array and imploding them with AND between each term: $where_array = array( ""(location = 'gb')"" ""(color = 3)"" ""(hair = 4)"" ); $where_expr = ""WHERE "" . implode("" AND "" $where_array); So how do you create the array with these terms? By writing code to append to the array conditionally for each input that is present in your app's current request: $where_array = array(); if (array_key_exists(""location"" $_GET)) { $location = mysql_real_escape_string($_GET[""location""]); $where_array[] = ""(location = '$location')""; } if (array_key_exists(""color"" $_GET)) { $color = mysql_real_escape_string($_GET[""color""]); $where_array[] = ""(color = '$color')""; } if (array_key_exists(""hair"" $_GET)) { $hair = mysql_real_escape_string($_GET[""hair""]); $where_array[] = ""(hair = '$hair')""; } After all that's done your array has between zero and three elements. If it has one or more you want to generate a WHERE clause as shown previously otherwise skip it. $where_expr = ''; if ($where_array) { $where_expr = ""WHERE "" . implode("" AND "" $where_array); } Then append the $where_expr to your baseline SQL query. $sql .= $where_expr The stuff about $params is for query parameters which is an alternative method of including dynamic values into an SQL expression instead of mysql_real_escape_string(). It's not mandatory (and in fact PHP's old mysql extension doesn't support query parameters) but I recommend switching to PDO so you can use this feature. See example here: PDO::prepare(). I must be tired... Hmmm i dont understand the param sections I'm still relatively new. and where() implode etc...my db class doesnt handle much more than connecting and making basic calls such as return row and query. Could you elaborate a little more please? Don't try to learn new coding techniques when you're too tired to concentrate. You're better off sleeping and coming back to it when you're fresh. It all makes sense after having a nights sleep! thank you for your more thorough explanation! :)  Here is my go at it: // discard empty values and unwanted keys $get = array_intersect_key(array_filter($_GET 'strlen') array_flip(array('location' 'color' 'hair'))); foreach ($get as $key => $value) { $get[$key] = $key . ' = ' . mysql_real_escape_string($value); } $sql .= ((count($get) == 0) ? null : ' WHERE ') . implode(' AND ' $get); I haven't tested it but it should work well. This also looks like a good method even less code but I accepted the answer above due to its in depth explanation Yes +1 but I used the more verbose code to show each step more clearly.

Do you have the JNI code and sample Java code to do this? I need this to call the Win32 GetWindowLong and SetWindowLong API calls which can be done via the Jawin library. I would like something very precise so I can pass a reference to the JDialog or JFrame and get the window handle. Swing transparency using JNI may be related. You don't have write any C/JNI code.

The following code lets you pass a Component to get the window handle (HWND) for it. To make sure that a Component has a corresponding window handle call isLightWeight() on the Component and verify that it equals false. If it doesn't try it's parent by calling Component.getParent().

I made sure it is _not_ lightweight and it is already visible on the screen. Has anything changed in Java 1.6 or is there anything else you need to do before you can get the drawing surface? No idea. Try asking a new question to get more eyes on the issue. pdinklag were you able to deal with that issue calling GetDrawingSurface? I experience the same problem now and jvm crashes in DSGetDrawingSurface. Tried with several jvms (1.6 and 1.7) - still crashes.  In JNA library we see that using Native AWT in Java 5 and 6 UnsatisfiedLinkError when run headless so use dynamic linking. See the method Java_com_sun_jna_Native_getWindowHandle0 in https://github.com/twall/jna/blob/master/native/dispatch.c.  This little JNI method accepts a window title and returns the corresponding window handle. JNIEXPORT jint JNICALL Java_JavaHowTo_getHwnd (JNIEnv *env jclass obj jstring title){ HWND hwnd = NULL; const char *str = NULL; str = (*env)->GetStringUTFChars(env title 0); hwnd = FindWindow(NULLstr); (*env)->ReleaseStringUTFChars(env title str); return (jint) hwnd; } UPDATE: With JNA it's a little bit easier. I made a small example which find the handle and use it to bring the program to front. This is not precise enough. I'd rather not hope that the window title is not in use by another window. just be sure to set the window title to something really really unique before the call (so you don't accidentally pick up the hwnd for another window with the same title - the FindWindow call is not process specific) You can replace the ""NULL"" with a class name to make the search more precise. You determine the window class name with a special tool like SPY++ or WinID. Small example is awesome  I found this: http://jna.java.net/javadoc/com/sun/jna/Native.html#getWindowID(java.awt.Window) JNA lets you call native libraries without having to write jni native code. Turns out the library itself has a method that takes a Window and produces an int presumably a handle (or pointer?) that hopefully works on all platforms. Actually getWindowPointer() is for Windows. According to their docs the method getWindowID() is for X11.  This is the same as Jared MacD's answer but it uses reflection so that the code can compile and load on a non-Windows computer.

1972877,Matlab's griddata3 for numpy? I realize that there is a griddata for numpy via matplotlib but is there a griddata3 (same has griddata but for higher dimensions). In other words I have (xyzd(xyz)) where (xyz) form an irregular grid and d(xyz) is a scalar function of three variables. I need to generate d(xiyizi) for a new set of (xiyizi) points using some kind of interpolation that can handle the non-uniformity of the original (xyz) data. Ultimately the (xiyizid(xiyizi)) data will have to be rendered as a surface somehow but that's a problem for later. I also do not have an analytical form for the d(.) function; I just have data for it. Any help appreciated. Not sure how you intend to render a surface of a scalar function of 3 variables except perhaps using cutplanes or something similar. Mayavi (really VTK which powers Mayavi) has support for efficient Delaunay triangulation via enthought.mayavi.mlab.pipeline.delaunay3d which is the core of the algorithm used by griddata3. See the 2D example code they have posted just add one dimension (and use delaunay3d instead). I don't know of a way to explicitly get the interpolated values used to render the surface but there might be a way to sample it through Mayavi you could dig through the documentation or ask on one of the Enthought mailing lists. Alternatively one of the C functions in the NCAR natgrid library may be useful i.e. dsgrid3d. There is a partial wrapper implemented as a matplotlib toolkit. thanks! I will look into these.  I am not familiar with griddata3 but you might want to look into meshgrid and this related post.  Scipy 0.9 (at the moment a first beta is out) has a new griddata function that can handle N-dimensional data. yay! great work!,python numpy analysis interpolation scientific-computing,0.12518967563668454,9.086577785826093E-4,7.766945176258453E-4,0.873124972067107
397500,How to design interface for a game in Java We're a team of a designer and a programmer. Me the programmer is hopeless on design of all sorts so the user interface of the game must be created by the designer. We were thinking of a main screen where the character walks around a small minimap in the top an inventory section etc. All these things would have to be designed in a way that looks pretty i.e nice graphics/buttons/colors etc. I'm assuming that the designer will create an outline of this interface in photoshop/illustrator then send me the file in .png or .jpeg format and I'll implement it into the program making sure the buttons all work etc. My question is is this the correct method for doing this? Should he send me the interface's layout in a .png/.jpeg format or send me only the buttons and I have to code the rest of the interface manually in java putting the buttons/icons where they need to be etc. If so how can I do this? Any classes/frameworks that do this? Any guidelines at all will be helpful. Thanks! You've described one of the primary use cases stated for JavaFX. There's at least one visual design tool already out for it as well. I've also seen articles on this blog that address the idea of taking visual assets from a graphic designer and working with them in an app. And of course you can drop into Java for the heavy lifting at any point.  It really depends on a few things..Is it for J2ME or are you considering this for desktop (OpenGL/JOGL)? For J2ME you have to really know a bit about making games for devices with constrained memory. J2ME comes with its own GameCanvas and Sprite related classes that you can utilise. I Would recommend you read up on J2ME game development either through google or buy a book. While there are 3D libraries for the J2ME environment I have never been impressed by it. For a desktop based game I would recommend using some form of accelerated hardware based libraries for 2D or 3D based games. Bit of a steep learning curve but better in the long run. Plenty of libraries out there to help you get started(Jogl and JAva3D for example) You should look into using some called a scene graph which will help you provide a good foundation to start from. Once again steep learning curve but much easier to maintain and develop with. In regards to your design/implementation question it seems you dont have much experience in this area.Generally graphic designers/UI interaction designer will have a better understanding of how to provide an interface for the game. They will generally develop a mock of some sortyou will implement it a test will be done with user's and feedback will determine where you go from there. If you dont have some form of interaction designer you or your designers will need to read up on it. Interaction through an interfaceespecially for games is not an easy thing and can make or break your game. But it seems that you should definitely do some reading up on game architectures before proceeding to implementation phase if you do not have experience in this area. It will help you understand some theory and get a foundation before going ahead and building something which inevitably turns out to be completely wrong.  Think up some weird XML format that completely describes the interface and make him create it. :)  take a look at this: http://www.cs.qub.ac.uk/~P.Hanna/CSC207/lectures/lectures.htm the link is not working anymore. :( anyone knows about resources related to this class?  I suggest you look at java games which do this already for examples of how this is done. e.g. http://sourceforge.net/projects/freecol/#item3rd-2 http://sourceforge.net/projects/megamek/#item3rd-2 http://sourceforge.net/project/screenshots.php?group_id=1111 +1 attaching similar reference: http://www.brackeen.com/javagamebook/  The designer will also have to learn something about game development how to produce textures that will work fine at different resolutions if it's a platformer to create sprites that lend themselves properly to animation and so on and so forth. Answering your question he'll probably need to do both (send you buttons sprites etc. and a global view to see how it all fits together).

Then you can use left join to group on all months: select year(mt.StartOfMonth)  month(mt.StartOfMonth)  e.type  count(*) from MonthTable mt left join Enquiries e on mt.StartOfMonth <= e.EnquiryDate and e.EnquiryDate < mt.StartOfMonth + interval 1 month where mt.StartOfMonth <= NOW() group by year(mt.StartOfMonth) month(mt.StartOfMonth) e.type,php sql mysql database datatable,4.671928095355123E-4,7.619044287121945E-4,0.9981860471245578,5.848556371944339E-4
793327,fixing glCopyTexSubImage2D upside down textures Since I've started learning about rendering to a texture I grew to understand that glCopyTexSubImage2D() will copy the designated portion of the screen upside down. I tried a couple of simple things that came to mind in order to prevent/work around this but couldn't find an elegant solution. there are two problems with doing a ::glScalef(1.0f -1.0f 1.0f) before rendering the texture to the screen: 1 I have to do this every time I'm using the texture. 2 I'm mostly working with 2D graphics and have backface culling turned off for GL_BACKsides. As much as possible I'd love to save switching this on and off. tried switching matrix mode to GL_TEXTURE and doing the ::glScalef(1.0f -1.0f 1.0f) transformation on capturing but the results were the same. (I'm guessing the texture matrix only has an effect on glTexCoord calls?) So how can I fix the up-down directions of textures captured with glCopyTexSubImage2D? If my understanding is correct it depends on where your origin is. That function seems to assume your origin is in the bottom-left whereas most 2D stuff assumes an origin of the top-left which is why it seems upside down. I suppose you could change the origin to the bottom-left do the capture then change the origin back to the top-left and render again before doing the swap. But that's a horrible solution since you're effectively rendering twice but it might be fine if you don't plan to do it every frame.  What are you going to be using the texture images for? Actually trying to render them upside down would usually take more work than moving that code somewhere else. If you're trying to use the image without exporting it just flipping the texture coordinates wherever you're using the result would be the most efficient way. If you're trying to export it then you either want to flip them yourself after rendering. On a related note if you are making a 2D game why is backface culling turned on? Good point. It was a case of guesswork optimization I'm afraid.=) Also I didn't need to flip textures for this game - not until now anyhow. I have still to see how much slower is it going to be but in the meantime turning backface culling off and flipping does seem to be the easiest and most elegant solution. Thank you!

2362063,MySql 'Select' help I have some tables. These tables all have one column in common called 'classified_id':  main_table: cars_table: id (PK) => 4222 id (PK) => 1021 classified_id => 25 classified_id => 25 Now I want whenever a search is performed to compare if any of the main_table.classified_id matches any of the cars_table.classified_id (in this case). the cars_table may return no matches! the classified_id in every table is the only relation. I would never need to compare the cars_table.classified_id to main_table.classified_id but the other way around is what I need (main_table.classified_id=cars_table.classified_id). I don't know what type of Join to use... Any help? Left Join? Thanks Please state more clearly what you are trying to do. Do you want to get only rows from main_table that are also in cars_table? Or do you want to get all rows from main_table and get some additional info that the row is also in cars_table? no only rows that match in both tables on classified_id SELECT * FROM main_table LEFT JOIN cars_table ON main_table.classified_id = cars_table.classified_id Will return 1-?? copies of main_table rows depending on how many in cars_table that matches. If there is no match all values from cars_table will be NULL  I'm not quite sure what you're asking but assuming you're looking for all the records in main_table that match some condition and you'd like to bring along any records in the cars_table that have the same classified_id as any of the matching records in the main table even if there are no such records in the cars_table you should be using left join like so:  SELECT * FROM main_table AS M LEFT JOIN cars_table as C ON C.classified_id = M.classified_id WHERE f(M.foo) When there is an M record such that f(M.foo) evaluates to TRUE but no corresponding C record the M record will still appear in the result set but all the C fields will be NULL. A more thorough explanation of left outer joins (same thing as a left join) can be found here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_outer_join#Sample_tables You'll need to look at the sample data to make sense of the example they give for left outer join: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_outer_join#Sample_tables  Yes it is a left join Something like SELECT * FROM main_table mt LEFT JOIN cars_table ct ON mt.classified_id = ct.classified_id Okay a short follow-up Q What would happen if I was to switch places of the variables around the 'equal' mark in your code so it would be 'ON ct.classified_id=mt.classified_id'?

And what mysql_fetch function are you using? fetch_assoc...... There are several ways to measure the size of data sent from your mysql server to your php process: Pure SQL Do your query and execute SHOW SESSION STATUS directly after it. You will get several statistics including the sent and received bytes: Bytes_received 191 Bytes_sent 120 Subtract the bytes from a SHOW SESSION STATUS query alone and you have the exact values. mysqlnd PHP 5.3 offers the ""MySQL Native Driver"" which gives you some nice options to debug your connection. Do your query and then call mysqli_get_connection_stats. It returns the network statistics too: Array ( [bytes_sent] => 43 [bytes_received] => 80 ... You need to use mysqli and mysqlnd here but you get more accurate numbers as with the pure SQL solution.  As a rouph estimate you coud try <?php // This is only an example the numbers below will // differ depending on your system echo memory_get_usage() .

Considering the problem it is likly Camran would know if there would be an issue with multibyte strings. Also consider that serialized string might not represent an accurate size compared to a array  I believe Petah's method of using memory_get_usage before and after is probably the easiest way.

662440,"Palette Animation in OpenGL I am making an old-school 2d game and I want to animate a specific color in my texture. Only ways I know are: opengl shaders. animating one color channel only. white texture under the color-animated texture. But I don't want to use shaders I want to make this game as simple as possible not many extra openGL functions etc.. And the color channel animating doesnt fit this because I need all color channels in my textures. Currently I am doing it with 2 textures: white texture under the other texture translated the specific pixel color into transparent then I change white texture color with glColor3f() function to what ever I want and I see the ""palet animation"" on that specific color. But that style sounds pretty hacky so I am wondering if there is some better trick to this? If you want your game to work on modern hardware the fragment shaders are pretty much your only option since paletted textures are deprecated and may not be available on newer hardware. The solution you have right now sounds reasonable especially since it will probably work everywhere.  How about just using paletted textures? There are extensions to do just that. If using extensions is out of question you can just make palette handling by your own. Just do your palette tricks there are lot of them and just write RGB texture using palette. Ofcourse this limits number of colors but thats whole point of using palette. Paint programs that are good for palette handling are nowadays rare. That's why I will not remove Deluxe Paint from my drive. ahh Deluxe Paint!  You may also use the stencil buffer to do something equivalent. Write into the stencil buffer at the positions where your animation should occur (= the positions that should have the animated color). Then render the box with the normal texture only on non-set positions of the stencil buffer using the corresponding stencil op. After that render the animated color into the resp. positions using different stencil op. I don't know if this really would be an improvement - depends also on in which way you have the data on your hands - but is probably less ""hackish"".  For a 2D game I think it's better to use ARB_vertex_program extension than GLSL. There are still OpenGL drivers out there that do not support GLSL but support ARB_fragment_program. Support for paletted textures is nowadays non-existent but pre-shader-age video cards may support it. See the links for statistics. The old ARB language is a low-level assembly language but you can use NVidia's high level Cg language to compile shaders to this format. Despite it being a NVidia technology it works for all GPUs. That said if you are programming the game for your own amusement it may not be worth the trouble.  While I am unfamiliar with the palette texture extension I still recommend using a fragment shader for this sort of effect. It is almost trivial to do a color-key replacement with a shader versus the other methods you mentioned and will be way faster than writing the palette functionality yourself. Here's an example GLSL fragment shader that would replace the color white in a texture for whatever color is passed in. uniform vec4 fvReplaceColor; uniform sampler2D baseMap; varying vec2 Texcoord; void main( void ) { vec4 fvBaseColor = texture2D( baseMap Texcoord); if(fvBaseColor == vec4(1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0)) fvBaseColor = fvReplaceColor; gl_FragColor = fvBaseColor; } Yes it does take a little bit extra to set up shader but but what it sounds like you are trying to do I feel it's the best approach.",c++ c opengl,0.9351895319791198,0.004926572102113197,0.04592070712288115,0.01396318879588575

461112,"Panel with line wrapping and line breaking in Java Swing How to implement a panel that would support line wrapping and line breaking? I would only add textual labels and line breaks to this panel. The labels should flow from left to right wrapping to the next ""line"" if needed. The line breaks would cause a jump to the next line. I would also like to make the panel vertically scrollable. The solution should work in Java 5. SwingX can be used. Clarification: The textual labels are actually JXHyperlinks (from SwingX) i.e. the panel contains clickable labels. This is the reason I cannot just use JTextArea. Although it may not be a solution you're in search of but from the requirements you have it seems like a custom LayoutManager may be able to achieve what you are after. By designing and assigning a custom Layout Manager which allows line breaks to a Container (such as Panel) it should be possible to have a Panel which allows line breaks. The Laying Out Components Within a Container article from The Java Tutorials will provide general information on how Layout Managers work in Java and in particular the Creating a Custom Layout Manager will provide information on how to make a custom Layout Manager to apply to an Container. The behavior of the FlowLayout (the default Layout Manager for Panel) seems fairly close to the behavior you may be after. Adding functionality to line break seems like the missing piece. Suggestion: Perhaps the custom Layout Manager can have the ability to add a line break by having a Component that represents a line break which can be added to a Container by using the add() method. For example have a class constant Component in the custom Layout Manager such as (a hypothetical) LineBreakLayout.LINE_BREAK and adding that to the Container can tell the custom layout manager to move to the next line. Perhaps an implementation can be like: Panel p = new Panel(new LineBreakLayout()); p.add(new Label(""First Line"")); p.add(LineBreakLayout.LINE_BREAK); p.add(new Label(""Second Line"")); The above hypothetical LineBreakLayout will then render the first Label in one line and the second Label in the second line.  I found JTextPane which I had overlooked before for some reason. This class does what I need. Thanks for your help though. :)  UPDATE: I missed the request for hyperlink support. Don't know how to do that w/o using the EditorPane. JTextArea does exactly what you've described. JTextArea textArea = new JTextArea(); JScrollPanel sPane = new JScrollPane(textArea); I want to make the labels clickable so that they could behave like hyperlinks. Could I do it with TextArea? (I don't want to use the JEditorPane with HTML.) Any reason against the JEditorPane (I'm just curious)? Seemed to be slow and an overkill. Also I couldn't figure out how to store a Java object with each hyperlink on the page so that clicking on the link would do some action based on the object. The Hyperlink event listener calls back with the Element and URL from anchor tag which caused the hyperlink. You could probably create some sort of mapping from URL->Object to take actions Right I currently have something like that. I'm just wondering if there is a better solution without such a mapping table. ahhh good deal. Now you've got me interested in the solution ;) Do you really don't know how to store an object for the hiperlink? In java there is a data structure named: ""Map"" with various subclasses. You can have map.put( aLink anObject ); and get the object when some link is used. It seems to me very straight forward.  This sample is not from a panel that is a container but from a JLabel that is intended to show content. You could use HTML in your content and use a <br> on each break. You should programmatically calculate the breaks according with your rules on component resize. Here's the code: import javax.swing.*; import java.awt.*; public class Wrap { public static void main( String [] args ) { JFrame frame = new JFrame(""Wrap test""); String text = ""<html>This<br>is<br>a<br>multiline<br>label</html>""; frame.add( new JLabel( text ) ); frame.pack(); frame.setVisible( true ); } } Yes I don't feel like implementing a map that would map strings to objects. I can use JXHyperlink (from SwingX) to store an object ""into the link"" and have an action performed on the object when the link is clicked. The problem is only how to layout the links so that they wrap in a scrollable pane. As per the hyperlinks you can have the by using a mouse listener. You can get where the object has been clicked and use a map to execute the action. But as reading your comments on basszero answer I think you just don't feel like program it.",java gui swing,1.9808497913429167E-4,0.9992778171702763,2.761250343865429E-4,2.4797281620282777E-4
491323,"Is it safe to construct Swing/AWT widgets NOT on the Event Dispatch Thread? I've been integrating the Substance look and feel into my application and ran into several problems regarding it's internal EDT (Event Dispatch Thread) checking routines. Substance absolutely refuses to construct UI classes outside of the EDT. I've done plenty of Swing/AWT and I know most of the rules regarding the EDT. I use SwingWorker SwingUtilties.invokeLater to modify components. I always though that components could be CONSTRUCTED outside of the EDT but must be realized and manipulated on the EDT. In other words you can construct and setup defaults in the background but the call to pack/setVisible must be EDT as well as any subsequent calls to manipulate the component. The reason I ask is that I have a particularly ""beefy"" window to construct involving many widgets state and resources (lots of icons). Previously I constructed the window on the background method of a SwingWorker and made the window visible in the done method. Never had a single problem. Upon switching to Substance the internal EDT checking bites me. I've been able to refactor code to get around this. I can construct on the EDT which isn't a good solution since the entire application will block. I can also refactor even more and try my best to load all of the extra resources outside of the EDT. Wrapping it up ... Is it safe to construct Swing/AWT widgets NOT on the Event Dispatch Thread? No. Simple reason is that even the EDT likes to deadlock in some rare cases and in general it's easy to deadlock the UI when using Swing (or so I've been told). I suggest you read these three articles from Kirill's (the Substance dev) blog: New article on Swing EDT violations Unwritten rule of working with Swing��s EDT Stricter checks on EDT violations in Substance  Sun has changed the rules in 2004 -- before you were allowed to create the components outside the EDT and only had to move into the EDT once the component had been realized. The new rule now reads: To avoid the possibility of deadlock you must take extreme care that Swing components and models are created modified and queried only from the event-dispatching thread. this blog post of mine gives more details including links to other related articles. note that all official Sun examples have been rewritten and are very strict about this. historically it probably was the increasing availability of multi-core computers as desktop machines that motivated the re-formulation of the rule -- threading issues became more and more apparent on the client stack and by being very strict on EDT guidelines a lot of them can be prevented from the start. sneaky sneaky ... thanks for the concrete evidence I was craving. Time to refactor! It's more race conditions than deadlocks that cause the problem. @tom: sorry i missed that the quote explicitly mentions the deadlocks -- but as said before i agree with you that it's more the race conditions... @tom: i agree about the race conditions -- never claimed it were the deadlocks have i (just referred to 'threading issues')?",java multithreading gui swing awt,2.4434363846760897E-4,0.9842030366113231,0.01027802811259883,0.005274591637610367
7269,"How can I identify in which Java Applet context I'm running without passing an ID? I'm part of a team that develops a pretty big Swing Java Applet. Most of our code is legacy and there are tons of singleton references. We've bunched all of them to a single ""application context"" singleton. What we now need is to create some way to separate the shared context (shared across all applets currently showing) and non-shared context (specific to each applet currently showing). However we don't have an ID at each of the locations that call to the singleton nor do we want to propagate the ID to all locations. What's the easiest way to identify in which applet context we're running? (I've tried messing with classloaders thread groups thread ids... so far I could find nothing that will enabled me to ID the origin of the call). Singletons are evil what do you expect? ;) Perhaps the most comprehensive approach would be to load the bulk of the applet in a different class loader (use java.net.URLClassLoader.newInstance). Then use a WeakHashMap to associate class loader with an applet. If you could split most of the code into a common class loader (as a parent of each per-applet class loader) and into the normal applet codebase that would be faster but more work. Other hacks: If you have access to any component you can use Component.getParent repeatedly or SwingUtilities.getRoot. If you are in a per-applet instance thread then you can set up a ThreadLocal. From the EDT you can read the current event from the queue (java.awt.EventQueue.getCurrentEvent()) and possibly find a component from that. Alternatively push an EventQueue with a overridden dispatchEvent method. This is (by far) the best collection of ideas I saw on the subject. I especially like the ""push a customized eventqueue"" - and I'm going to try it.  If I understand you correctly the idea is to get a different ""singleton"" object for each caller object or ""context"". One thing you can do is to create a thread-local global variable where you write the ID of the current context. (This can be done with AOP.) Then in the singleton getter the context ID is fetched from the thread-local to use as a key to the correct ""singleton"" instance for the calling context. Regarding AOP there should be no problem using it in applets since depending on your point-cuts the advices are woven at compile time and a JAR is added to the runtime dependencies. Hence no special evidence of AOP should remain at run time.  @Hugo regarding threadlocal: I thought about that solution. However from experiments I found two problems with that approach: Shared thread (server connections etc) are problematic. This can be solved though by paying special attention to these thread (they're all under my control and are pretty much isolated from the legacy code). The EDT thread is shared across all applets. I failed to find a way to force the creation of a new EDT thread for each applet. This means that the threadlocal for the EDT would be shared across the applets. This one I have no idea how to solve. Suggestions? You should be able to get a new EDT thread by using a different value for the archive tag. I think you can just add a random jar name to the end even if it does exist.",java swing applet,2.774264790087882E-4,0.9989885520824119,3.867249116557457E-4,3.472965269234517E-4
1599754,"Is there easy way in python to extrapolate data points to the future? I have a simple numpy array for every date there is a data point. Something like this: >>> import numpy as np >>> from datetime import date >>> from datetime import date >>> x = np.array( [(date(200835) 4800 ) (date(2008315) 4000 ) (date(20083 20) 3500 ) (date(200845) 3000 ) ] ) Is there easy way to extrapolate data points to the future: date(200851) date(2008 5 20) etc? I understand it can be done with mathematical algorithms. But here I am seeking for some low hanging fruit. Actually I like what numpy.linalg.solve does but it does not look applicable for the extrapolation. Maybe I am absolutely wrong. Actually to be more specific I am building a burn-down chart (xp term): 'x=date and y=volume of work to be done' so I have got the already done sprints and I want to visualise how the future sprints will go if the current situation persists. And finally I want to predict the release date. So the nature of 'volume of work to be done' is it always goes down on burn-down charts. Also I want to get the extrapolated release date: date when the volume becomes zero. This is all for showing to dev team how things go. The preciseness is not so important here :) The motivation of dev team is the main factor. That means I am absolutely fine with the very approximate extrapolation technique. When you googled for ""statistics python"" what did you find? Any questions on any of the statistical packages you found? It is hard to talk about any extrapolation without knowing the nature of the data in question. The above as far as one can see could be anything (not excluding random values) so to talk about any practical approach would be just speculating. Refine the question. you are absolutely right! refined. A simple way of doing extrapolations is to use interpolating polynomials or splines: there are many routines for this in scipy.interpolate and there are quite easy to use (just give the (x y) points and you get a function [a callable precisely]). Now as as been pointed in this thread you cannot expect the extrapolation to be always meaningful (especially when you are far from your data points) if you don't have a model for your data. However I encourage you to play with the polynomial or spline interpolations from scipy.interpolate to see whether the results you obtain suit you. like this definitely going to try thanks a lot!  The mathematical models are the way to go in this case. For instance if you have only three data points you can have absolutely no indication on how the trend will unfold (could be any of two parabola.) Get some statistics courses and try to implement the algorithms. Try Wikibooks. absolutely agree do understand it but want to clarify I am just checking if by some chance there is numpy.extrapolate function already in place with argument ""choose extrapolation method"" :) That's why I call it ""low hanging fruit""  It's all too easy for extrapolation to generate garbage; try this.

Is there something I'm missing? It looks like you're doing it correctly but your current color matrix sets the triangle's alpha value to 0 as well so while it is being drawn it does not appear on the screen. I added a glEnable(GL_BLEND); but it still doesn't affect the picture. It's still a red/green/blue triangle. It appears that the color matrix is having no effect. Actually the triangle is still drawn in its original red green and blue so I don't believe the color matrix is affecting the alpha component. the alpha component will only affect the final image if transparency is enabled which it apparently is not.  ""Additionally if the ARB_imaging extension is supported GL_COLOR is also accepted."" From the glMatrixMode documentation. Is the extension supported on your machine?

I have found the possible problem. The color matrix is supported by the ""Image Processing Subset"". In most HW it was supported by driver.(software implementation) Solution: Add this line after glEnd(): glCopyPixels(00 getWidth() getHeight()GL_COLOR); It's very slow....

181731,Texture Sampling in Open GL i need to get the color at a particular coordinate from a texture. There are 2 ways i can do this by getting and looking at the raw png data or by sampling my generated opengl texture. Is it possible to sample an opengl texture to get the color (RGBA) at a given UV or XY coord? If so how? Off the top of my head your options are Fetch the entire texture using glGetTexImage() and check the texel you're interested in. Draw the texel you're interested in (eg. by rendering a GL_POINTS primitive) then grab the pixel where you rendered it from the framebuffer by using glReadPixels. Keep a copy of the texture image handy and leave OpenGL out of it. Options 1 and 2 are horribly inefficient (although you could speed 2 up somewhat by using pixel-buffer-objects and doing the copy asynchronously). So my favourite by FAR is option 3. Edit: If you have the GL_APPLE_client_storage extension (ie. you're on a Mac or iPhone) then that's option 4 which is the winner by a long way. Outside of option 2 you need a method for sampling based on the texcoords though which is the hard part -- this is described in my answer. My understanding was that the poster was asking how to implement the 'getTexel' part of your example not how to replicate the filtering (which depends on what kind of filtering he wants to replicate anyway). I was sort of asking about the getTexel part but he's right that 1 and 2 are too slow esp considering i'm working on a mobile device. Thanks :) Mobile device? Would that be an iPhone by any chance? See updated answer. indeed it would Mike F thanks for the tip... altho in this case it does turn out that the data can be pre processed as raw image data before the creation of the openGL texture.  The most efficient way I've found to do it is to access the texture data (you should have our PNG decoded to make into a texture anyway) and interpolate between the texels yourself. Assuming your texcoords are [01] multiply texwidth*u and texheight*v and then use that to find the position on the texture. If they're whole numbers just use the pixel directly otherwise use the int parts to find the bordering pixels and interpolate between them based on the fractional parts. Here's some HLSL-like psuedocode for it. Should be fairly clear: float3 sample(float2 coord texture tex) { float x = tex.w * coord.x; // Get X coord in texture int ix = (int) x; // Get X coord as whole number float y = tex.h * coord.y; int iy = (int) y; float3 x1 = getTexel(ix iy); // Get top-left pixel float3 x2 = getTexel(ix+1 iy); // Get top-right pixel float3 y1 = getTexel(ix iy+1); // Get bottom-left pixel float3 y2 = getTexel(ix+1 iy+1); // Get bottom-right pixel float3 top = interpolate(x1 x2 frac(x)); // Interpolate between top two pixels based on the fractional part of the X coord float3 bottom = interpolate(y1 y2 frac(x)); // Interpolate between bottom two pixels return interpolate(top bottom frac(y)); // Interpolate between top and bottom based on fractional Y coord }  As others have suggested reading back a texture from VRAM is horribly inefficient and should be avoided like the plague if you're even remotely interested in performance.

I'm rewriting a MATLAB program to use Python / NumPy / SciPy and this is the only function I haven't found an equivalent to. A NumPy-based solution would be ideal but any language will do. The open source Python packageSciPy has quite a large set of optimization routines including some for multivariable problems with constraints (which is what fmincon does I believe).

For numerical optimization in Python you may take a look at OpenOpt solvers: http://openopt.org/NLP http://openopt.org/Problems  GNU Octave is another MATLAB clone that might have what you need.  Is your problem convex? Linear? Non-linear? I agree that SciPy.optimize will probably do the job but fmincon is a sort of bazooka for solving optimization problems and you'll be better off if you can confine it to one of the categories below (in increasing level of difficulty to solve efficiently) Linear Program (LP) Quadratic Program (QP) Convex Quadratically-Constrained Quadratic Program (QCQP) Second Order Cone Program (SOCP) Semidefinite Program (SDP) Non-Linear Convex Problem Non-Convex Problem There are also combinatoric problems such as Mixed-Integer Linear Programs (MILP) but you didn't mention any sort of integrality constraints suffice to say that they fall into a different class of problems. The CVXOpt package will be of great use to you if your problem is convex. If your problem is not convex you need to choose between finding a local solution or the global solution. Many convex solvers 'sort of' work in a non-convex domain. Finding a good approximation to the global solution would require some form Simulated Annealing or Genetic Algorithm. Finding the global solution will require an enumeration of all local solutions or a combinatorial strategy such as Branch and Bound.  Have a look at http://www.aemdesign.com/downloadfsqp.htm. There you will find C code which provides the same functionality as fmincon. (However using a different algorithm. You can read the manual if you are interested in the details.)

97586,Has anyone got an example of aerith style swing mixed with GUI maintainability of SWT editing? My boss loves VB (we work in a Java shop) because he thinks it's easy to learn and maintain. We want to replace some of the VB with java equivalents using the Eclipse SWT editor because we think it is almost as easy to maintain. To sell this we'd like to use an aerith style L&F. Can anyone provide an example of an SWT application still being able to edit the GUI in eclipse but having the Aerith L&F? SWT doesn't support look & feels. You can get different L&F's by altering your OS native L&F. The only exception is to using the eclipse forms toolkit. It still has the OS native feel but strives for a web-browser-like look. It does this mostly by setting everything to SWT.FLAT and using white backgrounds on everything. Occassionally they have to manually draw outlines around controls that don't natively support it. If you're looking for custom L&F's that will appear across platforms you really want Swing.  Like Heath Borders said SWT doesn't support L&Fs so you have to use Swing for that.

1993431,"OpenGL: Rendering more than 8 lights how? How should I implement more than 8 lights in OpenGL? I would like to render unlimited amounts of lights efficiently. So whats the preferred method for doing this? OpenGL lights is a simplistic system that as far as I know is already in the deprecated list. You should handle lights yourself by writing a shader. Take a look here. the tutorial says ""therefore the best approach is to compile different shaders for different numbers of lights."" umm... thats not really what i want to do since i can move in the world and sometimes there might be 100 lights rendered sometimes 10 lights... i wouldnt want to write up to 2000 shaders for every possible combination of visible lights. Or did i understand something horribly wrong :/  Deferred shading. In a nutshell you render your scene without any lights. Instead you store the normals and world positions along with the textured pixels into multiple frame-buffers (so called render targets). You can even do this in a single pass if you use a multiple render-target extension. Once you have your buffers prepared you start to render a bunch of full-screen quads each with a pixel shader program that reads out the normals and positions and computes the light for one or multiple light-sources. Since light is additive you can render as much full-screen quads as you want and accumulate the light for as much light-sources as you want. A final step does a composition between your light and the unlit textured frame-buffer. That's more or less the state-of-the-art way to do it. Getting fog and transparency working with such a system is a challenge though.",c++ opengl lights,0.8916787018342374,0.10694093563490487,7.272547499867518E-4,6.531077808709082E-4
664698,"How to I draw pixels as a texture to a polygon in OpenGL? In C++ OpenGL I want to draw each pixel manually (as a texture I assume) on to a simple square primitive or indeed 2 polygons forming a square. I have no idea where to start or what phrases to look for. Am I looking for texture mapping or creating textures? Most examples are to load from a file but I dont want to do that. I've tried reading my OpenGL Programming Guide book but its just a maze as I'm quite new to OpenGL. Please help. In other words you want to draw a texture without perspective? After you see the right tutorials check my post over here -> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/503816/linux-fastest-way-to-draw/504440#504440 The geometry is to be rotated transformed etc. in a 3D sense. I'm not sure what you mean ""draw without perspective""... Thanks to Reed Copsey for pointing me towards glTexImage2D. Turns out this is very simple; just pass an array of GLubyte to the glTexImage2D function (as well as all the functions needed to bind the texture etc). Haven't tried this exact snippet of code but it should work fine. The array elements represent a serial version of the rows columns and channels. int pixelIndex = 0; GLubyte pixels[400]; for (int x = 0; x < 10; x++) { for (int y = 0; y < 10; x++) { for (int channel = 0; channel < 4; channel++) { // 0 = black 255 = white pixels[pixelIndex++] = 255; } } } glTexImage2D( GL_TEXTURE_2D 0 GL_RGBA SIZE SIZE 0 GL_RGBA GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE pixels); I've read in the OpenGL book you can use a 2D array for monochrome images so I assume you could use a 3D array also.  If the square you are drawing to is 2 dimensional and not rotated you may be looking for glDrawPixels. It allows you to draw a rectangular region of pixels directly to the buffer without using any polygons.  If you are new then I would recommend starting from tutorial one on from NeHe.  Take a close look at glTexImage2D. This is the call that loads the image in OpenGL for a 2D Texture. glTexImage2D actually takes a raw pointer to the pixel data in the image. You can allocate memory yourself and set the image data directly (however you want) then call this function to pass the image to OpenGL. Once you've created the texture you can bind it to the state so that your triangles use that texture. There is nothing in OpenGL that directly requires images used as textures to be loaded from files. A good resource for textures can be found in this GameDev article.  What you are looking for is generally called ""render to texture."" http://developer.nvidia.com/object/gdc_oglrtt.html That tutorial is pretty old. I'd guess that some of those extensions aren't actually extensions in newer versions of OGL. Sorry I can't be more help. I don't work directly with graphics API's much any more and if I did I'd use D3D if I could (to avoid the extension soup and for other reasons I won't bore you with here.)  Do note that while glTexImage2D() takes a pointer to the pixels to load it does not care about any changes to that data after the call. That is the data is really loaded from the memory area you specify and OpenGL creates a copy of its own. This means that if the data changes you will need to either re-do the glTexImage2D() call or use something like glTexSubImage2D() to do a partial update. I would recommend testing and profiling to see if sub-texture updating is quick not sure how actual drivers optimize for that case.",c++ opengl textures,0.9410692589260471,4.628760624924781E-4,0.029254101834903578,0.02921376317655684

1903462,"How can I ""zip sort"" parallel numpy arrays? If I have two parallel lists and want to sort them by the order of the elements in the first it's very easy: >>> a = [2 3 1] >>> b = [4 6 2] >>> a b = zip(*sorted(zip(ab))) >>> print a (1 2 3) >>> print b (2 4 6) How can I do the same using numpy arrays without unpacking them into conventional Python lists? @YGA will your input array ""a"" ever have non-unique values? If so how would you like the sort to behave in that case? Arbitrary order? Stable sort? Secondary sort using corresponding values in array ""b""? Your question is the answer to my question -- I was searching for that kind of sort. b[a.argsort()] should do the trick. Here's how it works. First you need to find a permutation that sorts a. argsort is a method that computes this: >>> a = numpy.array([2 3 1]) >>> p = a.argsort() >>> p [2 0 1] You can easily check that this is right: >>> a[p] array([1 2 3]) Now apply the same permutation to b. >>> b = numpy.array([4 6 2]) >>> b[p] array([2 4 6]) This doesn't use `b` for ""auxiliary sorting"" for example when `a` has elements that repeat. Please see my answer for details. otoh auxiliary sorting is not always desired.  Here's an approach that creates no intermediate Python lists though it does require a NumPy ""record array"" to use for the sorting. If your two input arrays are actually related (like columns in a spreadsheet) then this might open up an advantageous way of dealing with your data in general rather than keeping two distinct arrays around all the time in which case you'd already have a record array and your original problem would be answered merely by calling sort() on your array. This does an in-place sort after packing both arrays into a record array: >>> from numpy import array rec >>> a = array([2 3 1]) >>> b = array([4 6 2]) >>> c = rec.fromarrays([a b]) >>> c.sort() >>> c.f1 # fromarrays adds field names beginning with f0 automatically array([2 4 6]) Edited to use rec.fromarrays() for simplicity skip redundant dtype use default sort key use default field names instead of specifying (based on this example). Thanks! I really wish I could accept two answers. This one is less simple but more general. I've upvoted it though as the least I could do :-)  This might the simplest and most general way to do what you want. (I used three arrays here but this will work on arrays of any shape whether two columns or two hundred). import numpy as NP fnx = lambda : NP.random.randint(0 10 6) a b c = fnx() fnx() fnx() abc = NP.column_stack((a b c)) keys = (abc[:0] abc[:1]) # sort on 2nd column resolve ties using 1st col indices = NP.lexsort(keys) # create index array ab_sorted = NP.take(abc indices axis=0) One quirk w/ lexsort is that you have to specify the keys in reverse order i.e. put your primary key second and your secondary key first. In my example i want to sort using the 2nd column as the primary key so i list it second; the 1st column resolves ties only but it is listed first). nice catch Brendan thanks.",python sorting numpy,0.006348661114674741,4.8528329962266206E-4,0.13958987263443404,0.8535761829512685
2221742,"Is there any way to know what cache size is needed? I am using mysql as a db. Is there any formula for determining the cache size needed to cache the results? Thanks Caching where? PHP has no cache - if you don't enough memory allocated the instance will through a fatal error and stop. There are lots of caches within MySQL by default it allocates large values for these. IME these can safely be left alone - note that any memory allocated for MySQL means less memory available for the system's I/O caching. Why do you think you need to fix something? C.  This is usually a function of how much spare RAM you have the size of your database and how much of the dataset is ""popular"". (Below is assuming that you are talking about an application-level cache and not I/O caches buffer caches or other lower-level caching.) If you're sizing your cache for performance (i.e. maximize throughput and minimize latency) then one simple formula would be to use as much as your spare RAM as possible that is less than your total database size. Another simple formula would be to start somewhere between 1% and 10% of your database size and grow based on usage. If you want to carefully calculate how much cache you need then the most reliable way to do it is by experimentation i.e. run load-tests against growing cache-sizes and graph the hit-rate (This is especially true if your database load/usage characteristics are complicated.) For example you can have a graph where the X-axis is the cache-size and the Y-axis has both hit-rate and query-latency. Your goal would be to find the minimum X (cache-size) where hit-rate is maximized and query-latency is minimized (these could be different points). In order to do this correctly you need a real-world load test i.e. if you keep logs of your queries you can replay them. You may want to limit your replay of only non-mutating queries only (for simplicity). Note that instead of loadtests you can simplify this process by adding a cache (start somewhere between 1% and 10%) to a live database then watching the hit-rate and query-latency over time. This is a bit easier to do if you don't have a load-test framework setup but may be more intrusive on a production system. If the hit-rate is too low (or query-latency too high) then grow the cache. If not then see if shrinking it makes a noticeable difference. (Of course there are edge cases here which I'm glossing over but this is the general idea. E.g. sometimes different types of queries can have different costs and you may need to allocate different caches for different query types.) Once you do have a cache you should monitor it's statistics along with other query stats such as latency. You may need to grow it over time. Or you may find that you need to warm the cache up before you can get any reliable performance. For example if you rely on your cache to be able to serve out a specific query-load and your caching component crashes starting up cold then your database will get overloaded for some period of time while the cache warms up. Anyhow the short answer is that there is no simple solution and sizing your cache best done by experimentation.",php sql mysql database,0.05996530594231431,4.3524309342968834E-4,0.71675305968952,0.22284639127473588
457463,"Putting JComboBox into JTable I want to put individual JComboBoxes into each cells of a JTable. ie. The JComboBox content is not identical for each cell. I basically would like to be able to just call the following code to add a row of JComboBox into the JTable. Anyone has any idea? Thanks JComboBox cb1 = new JComboBox(...); JComboBox cb2 = new JComboBox(...); model.addRow(new Object[] {""Row name"" cb1 cb2} ); JComboBox cb3 = new JComboBox(...); JComboBox cb4 = new JComboBox(...); model.addRow(new Object[] {""Row name 2"" cb3 cb4} ); This is the resultant view if I do the above. http://www.freeimagehosting.net/uploads/a6292e08ee.png The closest example code I can find is as follows. But it is for where JComboBox content is identical for the individual column. Not the solution I need. TableColumn col = table.getColumnModel().getColumn(vColIndex); col.setCellEditor(new MyComboBoxEditor(values)); where public class MyComboBoxEditor extends DefaultCellEditor { public MyComboBoxEditor(String[] items) { super(new JComboBox(items)); } } You need to create a subclass of JTable to override the method TableCellEditor getCellEditor(int row int column). This enables you to set arbitrary cell editors for any row and column combination. The default way is to set the cell editor for an entire column. (You can also set individual cell renderers by overriding getCellRenderer.)  I am sure this will solve your problem. Mention in which column you need to set the combo box in .getColumn(int column) private void addComboToTable(JComboBox combo) { TableColumn gradeColumn = YourTable.getColumnModel().getColumn(0); JComboBox comboBox = combo; comboBox.removeAllItems(); try { comboBox.addItem(""Item 1""); comboBox.addItem(""Item 2""); comboBox.addItem(""Item 3""); } catch (NullPointerException e) { } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } gradeColumn.setCellEditor(new DefaultCellEditor(comboBox)); }  There is a tutorial on a pattern of embedding components into JTables here: http://ivolo.mit.edu/post/A-Simple-Pattern-for-Embedding-Components-into-a-Swing-JTable.aspx  @Override public TableCellEditor getCellEditor(int row int column) { Object value = super.getValueAt(row column); if(value != null) { if(value instanceof JComboBox) { return new DefaultCellEditor((JComboBox)value); } return getDefaultEditor(value.getClass()); } return super.getCellEditor(row column); } And then override the toString method from JComboBox. This actually repeats [another answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/946949/572834) yet it adds one point: use a customized `JComboBox` so that its `toString()` method returns the selected value. In this case you could use the default `TableCellRenderer` implementation.  The easiest way is to implement your own TableModel public class MyModel extends AbstractTableModel { List rows; public int getRowCount() { return rows.size(); } public int getColumnCount() { return 4; } public Object getValueAt(int row int column) { return rows.get(row).getCol(col); //assuming your row ""Object"" has a getCol() } public Class<?> getColumnClass(int col) { return Boolean.class; } public void setValueAt(Object aValue int rowIndex int columnIndex) { rows.get(rowIndex).getCol(columnIndex).setValue(aValue); } } Load this into you JTable. If you haven't replaced the default cell renderer for Boolean's all you cells will be rendered as check boxes thanks to you implementation of getColumnClass(). All user input to these check boxes is collected with our setValueAt(). Err he asked about a JComboBox not JCheckBox. How did this answer even get accepted? @SarelBotha Because OP was last seen at Jan 31 '09 and the correct answer is from Jun 3 '09. Apparently no one thinks this is a problem. See [meta](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/161946/rethinking-sort-order-of-answers).  The JComboBox content is render identical for each row selection because the JTable does not offer the capability to have more than one editor per column. You have to extend the JTable class to support an additional selection for rows. This article explains it very well: http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/javatips/jw-javatip102.html  In addition to cellEditor it is necessary to do the cellRenderer to paint the combobox in the cell look at this:  public void example(){ TableColumn tmpColum =table.getColumnModel().getColumn(1); String[] DATA = { ""Data 1"" ""Data 2"" ""Data 3"" ""Data 4"" }; JComboBox comboBox = new JComboBox(DATA); DefaultCellEditor defaultCellEditor=new DefaultCellEditor(comboBox); tmpColum.setCellEditor(defaultCellEditor); tmpColum.setCellRenderer(new CheckBoxCellRenderer(comboBox)); table.repaint(); } /** Custom class for adding elements in the JComboBox. */ class CheckBoxCellRenderer implements TableCellRenderer { JComboBox combo; public CheckBoxCellRenderer(JComboBox comboBox) { this.combo = new JComboBox(); for (int i=0; i<comboBox.getItemCount(); i++){ combo.addItem(comboBox.getItemAt(i)); } } public Component getTableCellRendererComponent(JTable jtable Object value boolean isSelected boolean hasFocus int row int column) { combo.setSelectedItem(value); return combo; } }  You need to override: Component getTableCellRendererComponent(JTable table Object value boolean isSelected boolean hasFocus int row int column) ...in TableCellEditor. The value passed in to this method is what you can put in your JComboBox. That means that the 'value' for that particular cell needs to be something that can be translated into a collection. It could potentially just be a List of objects or it could be a POJO with fields that could be made into a JComboBox. So just edit MyComboBoxEditor to override that method and change your model to allow for an Object that actually represents several other objects.  This page might help you although it seems you are restricted to having the same combobox in all the cells in a column.  Extend JTable with this code: @Override public TableCellEditor getCellEditor(int row int column) { Object value = super.getValueAt(row column); if(value != null) { if(value instanceof JComboBox) { return new DefaultCellEditor((JComboBox)value); } return getDefaultEditor(value.getClass()); } return super.getCellEditor(row column); } This will create a unique JComboBox cell editor for each combo box you get the a value for. +1 -- one should also should set a custom `TableCellRenderer` on the `TableColumnModel` of the corresponding column in order to ensure that the selected value is drawn instead of a string `javax.swing.JCombobox[...]` while the cell is not being edited. This `TableCellRenderer` should implement `getTableCellRendererComponent(..)` and could return a `JLabel` with the value of `JComboBox.getSelectedItem().toString()` (after checking for null pointers).",java swing jtable jcombobox,1.3353756522238605E-4,0.7632666857032759,0.23643260763941912,1.6716909208251698E-4

If all light sources are disabled all objects are going to appear in a flat ambient color. Check to see what happens if you disable fog altogether. Does this still happen? No lighting is there if I comment fog draw and init in my scene render functon all is fine  You seem to not be clear on how GL_fog_coord_EXT works. You're saying that an object is ""outside the fog volume"" but OpenGL does not have any notion of a fog volume. At any point either Fog is completely off or it's on in which case the fog equation will be applied with a fog coefficient that depends both on the fog mode (LINEAR in your case) and the fog coordinate. Regarding the fog coordinate. when using  glFogi(GL_FOG_COORDINATE_SOURCE_EXT GL_FOG_COORDINATE_EXT); You're telling OpenGL that every time you'll provide a vertex you'll also provide which fog coordinate to use through glFogCoordfEXT So what does it mean in your case ? Assuming you're not calling glFogCoordfEXT in your teapot drawing code you'll end up with the value of your last call to glFogCoordfEXT which looks like a glFogCoordf(one). So everything drawn in that case will be fully in fog which is what you observe. Now I'm not sure exactly what you're trying to achieve so I don't know how to help you solve the issue exactly. However if the goal is to use your quads to mimic fog simply turn fog off when drawing the scene and turn it on only when drawing the cube (I'm pretty sure it won't look like nice fog though).

The local DB is constantly updated and every week or so the server DB need to be updated with the local data. You can call it 'mirrored DB' or 'master/master' but I'm not sure if this is correct. Right now the DB only exist locally. So: 1) First I need to copy the DB from local to server. With PHPMyAdmin export/import is impossible because of the DB size and PHPMyAdmin limits. Exporting the DB to a gzipped file and uploading it through FTP probably will break in the middle of the transfer because of connection to the server problems or because of the server file size limit. Exporting each table separately will be a pain and the size of each table will also be very big. So what is the better solution for this? 2) After the local DB us fully uploaded to the server I need to weekly update the server DB. What the better way to doing it? I never worked with this kind of scenario I don't know the different ways for achieving this and I'm not precisely strong with SQL so please explain yourself as good as possible. Thank you very much.

1055131,"How to modify a NumPy.recarray using its two views I am new to Python and Numpy and I am facing a problem that I can not modify a numpy.recarray when applying to masked views. I read recarray from a file then create two masked views then try to modify the values in for loop. Here is an example code. import numpy as np import matplotlib.mlab as mlab dat = mlab.csv2rec(args[0] delimiter=' ') m_Obsr = dat.is_observed == 1 m_ZeroScale = dat[m_Obsr].scale_mean < 0.01 for d in dat[m_Obsr][m_ZeroScale]: d.scale_mean = 1.0 But when I print the result newFile = args[0] + "".no-zero-scale"" mlab.rec2csv(dat[m_Obsr][m_ZeroScale] newFile delimiter=' ') All the scale_means in the files are still zero. I must be doing something wrong. Is there a proper way of modifying values of the view? Is it because I am applying two views one by one? Thank you. I think you have a misconception in this term ""masked views"" and should (re-)read The Book (now freely downloadable) to clarify your understanding. I quote from section 3.4.2: Advanced selection is triggered when the selection object obj is a non-tuple sequence object an ndarray (of data type integer or bool) or a tuple with at least one sequence object or ndarray (of data type integer or bool). There are two types of advanced indexing: integer and Boolean. Advanced selection always returns a copy of the data (contrast with basic slicing that returns a view). What you're doing here is advanced selection (of the Boolean kind) so you're getting a copy and never binding it anywhere -- you make your changes on the copy and then just let it go away then write a new fresh copy from the original. Once you understand the issue the solution should be simple: make your copy once make your changes on that copy and write that same copy. I.e.: dat = mlab.csv2rec(args[0] delimiter=' ') m_Obsr = dat.is_observed == 1 m_ZeroScale = dat[m_Obsr].scale_mean < 0.01 the_copy = dat[m_Obsr][m_ZeroScale] for d in the_copy: d.scale_mean = 1.0 newFile = args[0] + "".no-zero-scale"" mlab.rec2csv(the_copy newFile delimiter=' ') Yes you were right I did not realise I am doing an advanced selection and that the later returns a temporary copy. And my understanding of ""masked views"" is indeed very hazy. Thank you for the quote. I was reading the same section 3 earlier but did not get to this �_. Your fix will work. Though my question whether it is possible to modify the original data in dat without taking a copy of the part of the array. I need the order of the original to be preserved while modify only subset. Will simple iterative approach work? Or is there anything nicer? To modify dat itself I know nothing nicer than the ""simple iterative approach"" (generally on the .flat view as that IS indeed a view!-). BTW SO etiquette is that you upvote good answers and accept one that does answer your question or fix your problem -- since you comment ""your fix will work"" by that etiquette you should upvote and accept (and probably open another question specifically about selective modification in the main array itself -- somebody might give you a better approach than iteration if they saw that question but may not notice the question if you just ask it in a comment!)

473540,"Correct way to use Actions to create menus toolbars and other components in Java The naive way of writing building a menu in a Java Swing app is to do something like: JMenu fileMenu = new JMenu(""File""); JMenuItem openItem = new JMenuItem(""Open...""); openItem.addActionListener(new ActionListener() { /* action listener stuff */ } ) fileMenu.addMenuItem(openItem); A more experienced developer will recognize that actions can be accessed through a variety of mechanisms - menus toolbar buttons maybe even other workflows in the system. That person is more likely to write: Action openAction = new AbstractAction(); openAction.setName(""Open...""); openAction.addActionListener(new ActionListener() { /* action listener stuff */ } ) ... JMenuItem openItem = new JMenuItem(openAction); My question is what is the best way to manage these Action objects so they can be used across menus toolbars etc? Create a factory class that returns specific actions? Declare all of the actions as private static final Action in some utility class? Take advantage of a Java application framework? Something else? Duplicate of http://stackoverflow.com/questions/448179/organizing-actions-in-a-swing-application#448195  as pointed out by Dave Ray. Action is a bad abstraction - an ActionListener welded to a poor man's Map. Certainly do not assign them to a static as they are mutable and also need some context to operate usefully. My general advice for GUI programming is to note that it is actually much the same as any other area of programming. Follow the usual good practices. Notably layering separation of concerns use (implementation) inheritance rarely and don't write a big ball of mud.  You can group all your abstractAction using the dedicated Map javax.swing.actionmap . See http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/ActionMap.html Moreover each JComponent has an internal actionMap (getActionMap()). class MyComponent extends JPanel { public static final String ACTION_NAME1=""my.action.1""; public MyComponent() { AbstractAction action= new AbstractAction() { ... } getActionMap().put(ACTION_NAME1action); ... menu.add(getActionMap().get(ACTION_NAME1)); } } Hope it helps  Create a base action for your application; this will help you IMMENSELY later on Do create actions as you have in your code instead favor subclasses of your base action To organize them it will depend on what you are doing with them and you may have some actions organized one way and others created a different way. It will all depend. What you want is to have a consistent way to locate/create an action in your code. Depending on your UI you may need to differentiate between ""static"" actions (i.e. stuff that's always available in your app such as the menu system) and dynamic actions that are created only on certain screens or in certain locations. In any case using concrete subclasses of your specialized base action will help you keep these things organized. What you don't want is to be specifying things like labels mnemonics and icons all over the place in your code.  Applications that I have developed that need to use that same actions across menus toolbars and other buttons have been done using Swing Application Framework. Swing Application Framework This framework will allow you to have a resource file where you can define all menu text tooltips and ICONS. I think the icons are the key you do not have to load them yourself. Also if you have any actions that you need to enable/disable you can override the method to control its state. The website is worth the read.  Also see this question which is pretty much the same as what you're asking.  Edit: I got the feeling people didn't believe this was possible or easy so I did it--took about an hour from scratch--would have taken 40 mins if I'd just used a single method as a target instead of reflecting it out to separate methods for each menu item. Here's the Tested source code. It works but is one big method and ugly--refactor it if you use it. I may fix it up a little over the next few days I've always wanted to have a copy of this to keep around to reuse. --- original post First of all remember to separate your code from data. That means you should NEVER type: new Menu(""File...""); The string ""File..."" is data. If you start thinking this way you will find that your question answers itself. First you need to build up some data. You need to get ""File..."" and ""Save"" into menus. I generally start off with a string array (which you can easily move to a file) new String[]{""File...""""+Save""""Load""...} This is one of the simpler patterns I've started out with. Then you can parse out the + sign and use it to mean ""Drop down a level in the menu when you add this one"" This is just a silly convention invent your own if you don't like it. The next step is binding that to code to run. You could have them all call the same method but what a pain in the ass (Giant switch statement). One possibility is to use reflection to bind a method name while you are reading in the data. Here's one solution (again it might not fit your tastes) new String[]{""File...[fileMenu]""""+Save[saveMenu]""""Load[loadMenu]""...} Then you parse out the thing in square braces reflectively hook it up to a method in your current class and you are set. There is a temptation I ALWAYS have at this point and I've learned to fight it because it NEVER works out. The temptation is to use the first set of data (""File..."") and manipulate it to fit some pattern and auomatically bind to your code (in this case remove all non-alpha chars make the first letter lower case and append ""Menu"" to get the correct method name). Feel free to try this it's very attractive and seems slick but be ready to abandon it when it doesn't meet some need (such as two menu items with the exact same name in different sub-menus). Another way would be if your language supports closures then you could actually create the file name and closure in the same place.. Anyway once you start coding like this you'll find that ALL your menu construction is in a single 10 line method and you can alter it to suit your needs. I had a case where I had to change a set of menus to a button hierarchy and I did it in 2 minutes. In the end you can use this pattern to set up the action objects easily and change how they are used easily (in a single location single line of code) so you experiment with them. There are many ways to use them but if you don't do what I'm recommending here you will end up having to re-implement across every menu item for every change which is really annoying--after a single change you will have wasted more time than if you had just implemented a data-driven solution in the first place. This really isn't hard code should take like an hour or two then you never have to write new Menu(""... again. Trust me this kind of tooling is just about always worth it. edit: I just about always code data-driven these days. Usually I'll prototype a few things the normal way recognize the pattern and refactor--and if you are refactoring correctly the data just about always factors out and what you're left with is beautiful tight and maintainable. I could do what I suggested above in less than 1/2 an hour (maybe an hour to do the reflective version). This is almost always just as long as it would do to use the unfactored version and from then on your savings multiply for every change. This is very similar to what people like about ruby except with ruby they seem to insert even more data into their code (which makes it awfully hard to extract your data from the code completely which is always a nice goal for internationalization). Hmm did I mention that if you're good at extracting your data like this i18n is virtually free? I suggest you just give it a try sometime and see what you think. Embedding the control in the strings is unnecessary if it makes you uncomfortable. I tend to use string/object arrays just because they are really easy to enter are still in the file while you are coding and are trivial to externalize later but if you like YML or XML or properties files use whatever you're comfortable with--just abstract your data from your code! You really code your GUI's like this? :| How can your GUI be fully factored without being data driven? There is so much repetitiveness. By the way String.split (used to be StringTokenizer) can help a lot with parsing these items. A string like ""File...|*|fileMethod"" can be parsed in a second (the * means ""top level"" in this case--you can make up your ""language"" on the fly--very like a Ruby DSL but easier)",java gui swing,1.247312414293408E-4,0.9285260349847585,1.7387193354728505E-4,0.0711753618402648

1100100,"FFT-based 2D convolution and correlation in Python Is there a FFT-based 2D cross-correlation or convolution function built into scipy (or another popular library)? There are functions like these: scipy.signal.correlate2d - ""the direct method implemented by convolveND will be slow for large data"" scipy.ndimage.correlate - ""The array is correlated with the given kernel using exact calculation (i.e. not FFT)."" scipy.fftpack.convolve.convolve which I don't really understand but seems wrong Numarray had a correlate2d() function with a 'fft=True' switch (http://structure.usc.edu/numarray/node61.html) but I guess numarray was folded into numpy and I can't find if this function was included. note that using exact calculation (no FFT) is exactly the same as saying it is slow :) More exactly the FFT-based method will be much faster if you have a signal and a kernel of approximately the same size (if the kernel is much smaller than the input then FFT may actually be slower than the direct computation). Oh you're not talking about zero padding you're talking about matching a 5x5 image with a 2000x2000 image. Why can't the algorithm just guess whether the FFT would be more efficient and do it whichever way is faster? Ideally the FFT algorithm would automatically take care of zero-padding things to the right size for best speed. scipy has an fftconvolve function http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.fftconvolve.html#scipy.signal.fftconvolve I wrote a cross-correlation/convolution wrapper that takes care of padding & nans and includes a simple smooth wrapper here. It's not a popular package but it also has no dependencies besides numpy (or fftw for faster ffts). I've also implemented an FFT speed testing code here in case anyone's interested. It shows - surprisingly - that numpy's fft is faster than scipy's at least on my machine. EDIT: moved code to N-dimensional version here  I've lost track of the status of this package in scipy but I know we include ndimage as part of the stsci_python release package as a convenience for our users: http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/pyraf/stsci_python/current/download or you should be able pull it from the repository if you prefer: https://www.stsci.edu/svn/ssb/stsci_python/stsci_python/trunk/ndimage/ Turns out stsci is being removed from SciPy (which is why it doesn't work) and the stsci_python version is now the authoritative one so I'm moving this to be the accepted answer. According to SciPy docs it's not FFT-based though as I mentioned in the question. http://www.scipy.org/SciPyPackages/Ndimage Oh! I can just import that python file directly if I remove the reference to _correlate. The FFT correlation is all in Python. Now I've got it working. :) Thanks! The convolve package is also available from the stsci_python repository.

It works on my Windows machine with 2.6 but not on other Ubuntu machines so it must be a packaging issue with Ubuntu. https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/397217 you could use correlate2d from scipy.signal: it uses more or less the same implementation technique as the stsci.convolve one (no FFT). The 2.6 problem is weird - may be related to a distutils thing.  I found scipy.signal.fftconvolve as also pointed out by magnus but didn't realize at the time that it's n-dimensional.

In [4]: stsci.convolve2d(a b fft = True) Out[4]: array([[-12. -12. -12.] [-24. -24. -24.] [-12. -12. -12.]]) (The STSCI method also requires compiling which I was unsuccessful with (I just commented out the non-python parts) has some bugs like this and modifying the inputs ([1 2] becomes [[1 2]]) etc. So I changed my accepted answer to the built-in fftconvolve() function.) Correlation of course is the same thing as convolution but with one input reversed: In [5]: a Out[5]: array([[3 0 0] [2 0 0] [1 0 0]]) In [6]: b Out[6]: array([[3 2 1] [0 0 0] [0 0 0]]) In [7]: scipy.signal.fftconvolve(a b[::-1 ::-1]) Out[7]: array([[ 0. -0. 0. 0. 0.] [ 0. -0. 0. 0. 0.] [ 3. 6. 9. 0. 0.] [ 2. 4. 6. 0. 0.] [ 1. 2. 3. 0. 0.]]) In [8]: scipy.signal.correlate2d(a b) Out[8]: array([[0 0 0 0 0] [0 0 0 0 0] [3 6 9 0 0] [2 4 6 0 0] [1 2 3 0 0]]) and the latest revision has been sped up by using power-of-two sizes internally (and then I sped it up more by using real FFT for real input and using 5-smooth lengths instead of powers of 2 :D ).  look at scipy.signal.fftconvolve signal.convolve and signal.correlate (there is a signal.correlate2d but it seems to return an shifted array not centered).

1066758,"find length of sequences of identical values in a numpy array In a pylab program (which could probably be a matlab program as well) I have a numpy array of numbers representing distances: d[t] is the distance at time t (and the timespan of my data is len(d) time units). The events I'm interested in are when the distance is below a certain threshold and I want to compute the duration of these events. It's easy to get an array of booleans with b = d<threshold and the problem comes down to computing the sequence of the lengths of the True-only words in b. But I do not know how to do that efficiently (i.e. using numpy primitives) and I resorted to walk the array and to do manual change detection (i.e. initialize counter when value goes from False to True increase counter as long as value is True and output the counter to the sequence when value goes back to False). But this is tremendously slow. How to efficienly detect that sort of sequences in numpy arrays ? Below is some python code that illustrates my problem : the fourth dot takes a very long time to appear (if not increase the size of the array) from pylab import * threshold = 7 print '.' d = 10*rand(10000000) print '.' b = d<threshold print '.' durations=[] for i in xrange(len(b)): if b[i] and (i==0 or not b[i-1]): counter=1 if i>0 and b[i-1] and b[i]: counter+=1 if (b[i-1] and not b[i]) or i==len(b)-1: durations.append(counter) print '.' durations = [] counter = 0 for bool in b: if bool: counter += 1 elif counter > 0: durations.append(counter) counter = 0 if counter > 0: durations.append(counter) sure this is more consise but just as inefficient ; what I want to do is move the loop down to the C layer by means of using some clever combination of numpy calls... check my edited answer I now offer one such ""clever combinations"" (always trying hard not to be TOO clever though;-) -- but do measure the speed of that one AND the itertools.groupby-based solution and let us know which one is faster (and by how much) in examples realistic-for-you!  Here is a solution using only arrays: it takes an array containing a sequence of bools and counts the length of the transitions. >>> from numpy import array arange >>> b = array([000111000111100] dtype=bool) >>> sw = (b[:-1] ^ b[1:]); print sw [False False True False False True False False True False False False True False] >>> isw = arange(len(sw))[sw]; print isw [ 2 5 8 12] >>> lens = isw[1::2] - isw[::2]; print lens [3 4] sw contains a true where there is a switch isw converts them in indexes. The items of isw are then subtracted pairwise in lens. Notice that if the sequence started with an 1 it would count the length of the 0s sequences: this can be fixed in the indexing to compute lens. Also I have not tested corner cases such sequences of length 1.  Just in case anyone is curious (and since you mentioned MATLAB in passing) here's one way to solve it in MATLAB: threshold = 7; d = 10*rand(1100000); % Sample data b = diff([false (d < threshold) false]); durations = find(b == -1)-find(b == 1); I'm not too familiar with Python but maybe this could help give you some ideas. =) thanks for this answer as well this is exactly the kind of stuff I was looking for diff() exists in numpy too so this is more or less what you want though replace find(foo) with where(foo)[0].  While not numpy primitives itertools functions are often very fast so do give this one a try (and measure times for various solutions including this one of course): def runs_of_ones(bits): for bit group in itertools.groupby(bits): if bit: yield sum(group) If you do need the values in a list just can use list(runs_of_ones(bits)) of course; but maybe a list comprehension might be marginally faster still: def runs_of_ones_list(bits): return [sum(g) for b g in itertools.groupby(bits) if b] Moving to ""numpy-native"" possibilities what about: def runs_of_ones_array(bits): # make sure all runs of ones are well-bounded bounded = numpy.hstack(([0] bits [0])) # get 1 at run starts and -1 at run ends difs = numpy.diff(bounded) run_starts = numpy.where(difs > 0) run_ends = numpy.where(difs < 0) return run_ends - run_starts Again: be sure to benchmark solutions against each others in realistic-for-you examples!

When calling setVisible the parent will be notified and asked to repaint itself.  frame.setContentPane(newContents()); frame.revalidate(); // frame.pack() if you want to resize. Remember Java use 'copy reference by value' argument passing. So changing a variable wont change copies of the reference passed to other methods. Also note JFrame is very confusing in the name of usability. Adding a component or setting a layout (usually) performs the operation on the content pane. Oddly enough getting the layout really does give you the frame's layout manager. Tom thanks for your reply. I'm not aiming to replace the contentpane just a jpanel placed on it (like frame.add(jpanel1) frame.add(jpanel2) frame.add(jpanel3)). Could you plz suggest a sane solution in code? Hey John Your use case seems perfect for CardLayout. http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/layout/card.html In card layout you can add multiple panels in the same place but then show or hide one panel at a time. @swapnonil: Make that an answer so I can vote it up. :) You may run into problems when using the setContentPane() method. I had cases where all (custom) cursors not showing up anymore after calling it.  1) Setting the first Panel: JFrame frame=new JFrame(); frame.getContentPane().add(new JPanel()); 2)Replacing the panel: frame.getContentPane().removeAll(); frame.getContentPane().add(new JPanel()); Also notice that you must do this in the Event's Thread to ensure this use the SwingUtilities.invokeLater or the SwingWorker  class Frame1 extends javax.swing.JFrame { remove(previouspanel); //or getContentPane().removeAll(); add(newpanel); //or setContentPane(newpanel); invalidate(); validate(); // or ((JComponent) getContentPane()).revalidate(); repaint(); //DO NOT FORGET REPAINT } Sometimes you can do the work without using the revalidation and sometimes without using the repaint.My advise use both.  The other individuals answered the question. I want to suggest you use a JTabbedPane instead of replacing content. As a general rule it is bad to have visual elements of your application disappear or be replaced by other content. Certainly there are exceptions to every rule and only you and your user community can decide the best approach.  I was having exactly the same problem!! Increadible!! The solution I found was: Adding all the components (JPanels) to the container; Using the setVisible(false) method to all of them; On user action setting setVisible(true) to the panel I wanted to show. // Hiding all components (JPanels) added to a container (ex: another JPanel) for (Component component : this.container.getComponents()) { component.setVisible(false); } // Showing only the selected JPanel the one user wants to see panel.setVisible(true); No revalidate() no validate() no CardLayout needed.  On the user action: // you have to do something along the lines of myJFrame.getContentPane().removeAll() myJFrame.getContentPane().invalidate() myJFrame.getContentPane().add(newContentPanel) myJFrame.getContentPane().revalidate() Then you can resize your wndow as needed.  Your use case seems perfect for CardLayout. In card layout you can add multiple panels in the same place but then show or hide one panel at a time. When using CardLayout keep in mind that the preferred size for the panel that uses it will be the size of the LARGEST panel in the layout. If you want the space to be reclaimed you will want to use setVisible(false) and setPreferredSize( new Dimension( 00 ) ) to hide a component. I hadn't heard of CardLayout before. Thanks - was perfect for something I needed to do.  Hope this piece of code give you an idea of changing jPanels inside a JFrame. public class PanelTest extends JFrame { Container contentPane; public PanelTest() { super(""Changing JPanel inside a JFrame""); contentPane=getContentPane(); } public void createChangePanel() { contentPane.removeAll(); JPanel newPanel=new JPanel(); contentPane.add(newPanel); System.out.println(""new panel created"");//for debugging purposes validate(); setVisible(true); } }  Problem: My component does not appear after I have added it to the container. You need to invoke revalidate and repaint after adding a component before it will show up in your container. Source: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/layout/problems.html  Just call the method pack() after setting the ContentPane (java 1.7 maybe older) like this: JFrame frame = new JFrame(); JPanel panel1 = new JPanel(); JPanel panel2 = new JPanel(); .... frame.setContentPane(panel1); frame.pack(); ... frame.setContentPane(panel2); frame.pack(); ...  It all depends on how its going to be used. If you will want to switch back and forth between these two panels then use a CardLayout. If you are only switching from the first to the second once and (and not going back) then I would use telcontars suggestion and just replace it. Though if the JPanel isn't the only thing in your frame I would use remove(java.awt.Component) instead of removeAll. If you are somewhere in between these two cases its basically a time-space tradeoff. The CardLayout will save you time but take up more memory by having to keep this whole other panel in memory at all times. But if you just replace the panel when needed and construct it on demand you don't have to keep that meory around but it takes more time to switch. Also you can try a JTabbedPane to use tabs instead (its even easier than CardLayout because it handles the showing/hiding automitically)",java swing jpanel layout-manager cardlayout,1.4845303214777353E-4,0.9964399850063478,2.0693945995168205E-4,0.003204622501552666
286674,Remoting from a Swing app to GWT server To put it simple I've written a JSE Swing app that needs to talk to a GWT server I've written earlier. I absolutely love the way GWT does remoting between it's javascript and server sides and wish I could utilize this mechanism. Has anyone managed to use GWT-RPC this way? Should I just go Restlet instead? If you are doing Java-to-Java communication RMI would be simpler and more expedient. Serializing data to/from some XML or URL-based format doesn't add a lot of value. With EJB3 it is dead simple to deploy remote objects and to call them. You can then turn those EJBs into web services if you need to later but for Java-to-Java I can't think of a good reason to not use some sort of RMI-based communication. RMI does not work at the moment on AppEngine. I'm not sure if Google will fix that,java swing gwt remoting restlet,0.0010190012129403139,0.9755635870542128,0.022141774369573618,0.0012756373632732624
407506,Is Google Web Toolkit similar to AWT and Swing I've looked breifly into GWT and like the idea that I can develop in Java and have the application compile down to HTML and JavaScript. Is the concept behind GWT and AWT and Swing the same or different? AWT and Swing are for programming stand-alone applications (and to a lesser extent applets). GWT is supposed to make programming web applications similar to stand-alone apps. I wouldn't program a non-web app using GWT.  It is programmed very similarly(patterned after Swing) and the code is 100% java (compiles with a standard Java compiler without errors) but the way it works is very different. Instead of compiling into a Java app it compiles into Javascript that is sent to your browser. This ability to program good active Javascript without actually coding Javascript and HTML is pretty nice. Also since it programs much like swing you can do stuff like adding listeners that effect other controls pretty easily. Actually GTW supports only a strict subset of Java's standard libraries. There are some libraries that aren't supported simply because they can't be represented in JavaScript. For example GWT's Random is a util class with static methods while Java 1.5 uses it as an object etc...  disclamer: While I do work at IT Mill this is just for information to the original poster. This isn't marketing spam. If you like the idea of being able to write Java and get a webpage out of that you might be interested in IT Mill Toolkit. It's a toolkit for making RIA software on top of a J2EE stack and it uses GWT heavily. One of the basic ideas are that the code generated by GWT is just as prone to client-side forging attacks as any other JS/Ajax-traffic. IT Mill Toolkit makes sure that the data is validated server-side too. The toolkit is also designed in such a way that if you are familiar to Swing you should have no problems picking it up.  GWT is very much similar to Swing in its usage of Widgets Panels and the EventListeners it provides. A different way to look at GWT is to think of Javascript and HTML as Assembly language and GWT as a sort of High level language which generates Javascript and HTML. With GWT its easy to develop desktop-like apps for the web using the same tools you would use for building a desktop app  GWT is conceptually similar to Swing but is more a replacement for JSPs than anything else. I agree. Though you still use Java on the server side.  GWT is a javascript toolkit that allows you to write the javascript in Java. The only real similarities to Swing and AWT are that they are toolkits for creating user interfaces and they use Java. The end product is different and the real purpose for using them is different. GWT gives you the ability to generate a ajax user interface for a web browser while the other 2 give you a console (or applet) java app. In my mind the real reason for using GWT is to get a quick ajax interface up for prototyping purposes. But I dont think its really production ready- ie I dont thing Google uses it in their own webapps. A better choice for more robust ajax webapps is http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/ or http://script.aculo.us/.  Define concept. AWT/Swing are used for desktop Java apps or applets. They both require JVM to run. GWT is used to translate Java code to Javascript. This only runs on Javascript engines i.e. browser. The API design as stated above is similar to Swing. You get the same Panels Buttons and other Component classes as in Swing.,java swing gwt awt,2.4434363846760897E-4,0.9991091662728556,3.406083382438639E-4,3.0588175043288476E-4
2410994,"MySql displaying results in same order no matter ""array-order"" I am using ""solr"" search engine to query an index for classifieds that match a given criteria. The results are the ID:numbers of the classifieds which I then use to find all matches in a MySql database with those ID:s. The ID:s returned are put into an array. As you can see below the array is imploded. Then I use the ""IN"" to find all matches. $solr_id_arr_imploded = implode(""' '"" $solr_id_arr); $query = ""SELECT mt.* $sql_tbl.* FROM classified mt LEFT JOIN $sql_tbl ON $sql_tbl.classified_id = mt.classified_id WHERE mt.ad_id IN ('$solr_id_arr_imploded')""; $sql_tbl is the category chosen by the user in this case lets say it is ""cars"". My problem is this: I have the ID:numbers in an order (inside the array) but MySql doens't ""care"" about this order. MySql displays the oldest item first no matter what order the array is in. So here is one same query displayed with two different ""array-directions"": SELECT mt.* fordon.* FROM classified mt LEFT JOIN fordon ON fordon.classified_id = mt.classified_id WHERE mt.ad_id IN ('Bmw_520i_Svensksald_784332731' 'Bmw_M3_Svensksald_755599519' 'Bmw_M3_E46_Full-utrustad_338210082') SELECT mt.* fordon.* FROM classified mt LEFT JOIN fordon ON fordon.classified_id = mt.classified_id WHERE mt.ad_id IN ('Bmw_M3_E46_Full-utrustad_338210082' 'Bmw_M3_Svensksald_755599519' 'Bmw_520i_Svensksald_784332731') As you can see the ID:s are reversed in the second query above... But they are still displayed in the same order anyways. Why? Should I use some other method of finding all MySql matches with ID:s from an array? Ideas? Thanks MySQL will return the data in the order it ""wants"" (I suppose it'll be the order of the clustered index or something like that) if you do not specify an order by clause. If you want to change the order in which MySQL returns the results you'll have to add an order by clause. If that's not possible in your case you'll have to re-order the elements from the PHP code -- for instance instead of displaying the results from what MySQL returns you should iterate over the list of ids returned by Solr and display the results starting from there. Basically you'll first execute the MySQL query to fetch the results : SELECT mt.* fordon.* FROM classified mt LEFT JOIN fordon ON fordon.classified_id = mt.classified_id WHERE mt.ad_id IN ( 'Bmw_520i_Svensksald_784332731' 'Bmw_M3_Svensksald_755599519' 'Bmw_M3_E46_Full-utrustad_338210082' ) Then you can loop over those results in PHP storing them in an associative array (pseudo-code) : $hash = array(); foreach ($db_results as $elem) { $hash[$elem->ad_id] = $elem; } $hash will contain the data indexed by id. And then you'll display the data using what Solr returned as a starting point for the loop (pseudo-code) : foreach ($solr_results as $id_solr) { echo $hash[$id_solr]->some_field . '<br />'; } With this you will : display the results in the order returned by Solr not do an additionnal (and possibily costly) sort on the database-side.  This should do it: SELECT mt.* $sql_tbl.* FROM classified mt LEFT JOIN $sql_tbl ON $sql_tbl.classified_id = mt.classified_id WHERE mt.ad_id IN ('$solr_id_arr_imploded') ORDER BY FIELD(mt.ad_id'$solr_id_arr_imploded') See Order By Field in Sorting Rows.",php sql mysql database arrays,2.4075491449548808E-4,3.926264100055568E-4,0.9990652294716176,3.013892038812449E-4

I know how to work out the new X and Y position MovementX = cos(angle) * MoveDistance; MovementY = sin(angle) * MoveDistance; But then I realised that these values will change because of Z won't they? How do I work out Z and have I worked out X and Y correctly? Thanks! Use rotation matrices. :) They take a considerable investment of effort to learn but once you know how to use them everything becomes much less work. Well a point at (000) rotated at any angle at the xy or z axis will stay a (000). Assuming by ""forward"" you mean the direction pointing along the z-axis the components of the movement vector become: MovementX = 0; MovementY = 0; MovementZ = 10. Seriously try to ask exactly what you want to know. Ok I guess the equivalent in OpenGL would be... glRotatef( 30.0f 0.0f 1.0f 0.0f ); glRotatef( 30.0f 1.0f 0.0f 0.0f ); glTranslate( 0.0f 0.0f 10.0f ); But I want to do it manually so that I know the world coordinates of the point (so that I can compare it to other coordinates) I don't know too much about OpenGL but if your point is starting at (000) then drhirsch is correct and your point won't be moving anywhere through rotations. So the only function that would do anything is the glTranslate. Therefore your new position would be (0010). However I feel like that might not be what you were going for. Are you sure your point doesn't have a direction vector associated with it?

3284275,"concat tables with different content I am currently building a small web application for publishing stories using PHP and MySQL. Each story may either be a article (with lots of fields and data) just a hyperlink/url just an image or a downloadable file with certain attributes (once again with lots of fields). My problem is related to finding the optimal database layout for the system. I have thought about 3 different solutions that may or may not work (fields are just examples don't get caught of with whether the data should be stored in the database or not): 1) Making one table for each type and just UNION them. E.g: articles id | date | title | author | preview | last_edited | category | content hyperlinks id | date | title | author | url pictures id | date | title | author | thumbnail | fullimg files id | date | title | author | filetype | filename | filecontent Is it possible to make a SQL statement that will concat these in such a way that every field is added to the rows from the individual tables and the individual row is ""tagged"" with its type depending on which table its from? Or do I have to settle for just the common fields (3-4 field WILL be identical for each table) and to individual lookups for each row? 2) Making some sort of index table that references the correct table and row depending on the type? index id | type | title | date | referenceid -> either articles hyperlinks pictures or files depending on the ""type"" field. Is this possible in some way when using foreign keys? I suspect no but not really sure what you can and can not do in MySQL. 3) Have ALL fields for ALL types in one and the same table and just make the specific field nullable (I dont really like this solution since it appears messy). Any ideas? I suspect I can not be the first person to have encountered the issue of references to different entity types/fields depending on some sort of type. Ideas are highly appreciated. If you name fields you can union then quite easily and throw in whatever constants you like. I do this all the time: Select id 'articles' as tablename title author preview last_edited category '' as url from articles UNION Select id 'hyperlinks' as tablename title author '' as preview '' as last_edited '' as category url From hyperlinks ... UNION is inherently slow. For SQL Server UNION ALL is a lot faster - not sure about mySQL. But like everything else with databases performance is dependent on too many factors to isolate. Unless you are dealing with gobs of data I wouldn't expect this query to be the choke point. What would be the performance penalty of solving it in this way? I am quite interested in finding out the different advantages and disadvantages of possible solutions.  I'd add a 'type' column to each table that specifies what table it came from and then do an equijoin followed by a group: SELECT * FROM articles a INNER JOIN hyperlinks h ON a.id =h.id AND a.date=h.date AND a.title=h.title AND a.author=h.author JOIN pictures p ON h.id=p.id AND h.date=p.date AND h.title=p.title AND h.author=p.author JOIN files f ON p.id=f.id AND p.date=f.date AND p.title=f.title AND p.author=f.author ORDER BY type; It's an ugly-looking query but it should do what you want... What would be the performance penalty of solving it in this way?  You have so few fields just put them all in one table and add a type field. No sense overcomplicating things.  I'd suggest adding a stories table to be the central table. This allows for a great deal of flexibility in the system design and centralizes the data that is core to a story. Something along these lines: stories id date title author article_id hyperlink_id picture_id file_id articles id preview last_edited category content hyperlinks id url pictures id thumb full files id filetype filename filecontent Won't this have some issues with foreign keys and stuff like that if for instance article_id isn't relevant for that particular entry?

Think about a rouge applet monitoring the clipboard ""pasting"" everything and sending it over the wire to a remote server. Your PIN for example. The solution is to sign your applet thereby telling the client ""It is in (your name here) responsibility that this applet is not evil."" and asking the user if he/she believes you.

643699,"How can I use numpy.correlate to do autocorrelation? I need to do auto-correlation of a set of numbers which as I understand it is just the correlation of the set with itself. I've tried it using numpy's correlate function but I don't believe the result as it almost always gives a vector where the first number is not the largest as it ought to be. So this question is really two questions: What exactly is numpy.correlate doing? How can I use it (or something else) to do auto-correlation? See also: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12269834/is-there-any-numpy-autocorrellation-function-with-standardized-output for information about normalized autocorrelation. Auto-correlation comes in two versions: statistical and convolution. They both do the same except for a little detail: The former is normalized to be on the interval [-11]. Here is an example of how you do the statistical one: def acf(x length=20): return numpy.array([1]+[numpy.corrcoef(x[:-i] x[i:]) \ for i in range(1 length)]) You want ``numpy.corrcoef[x:-i] x[i:])[01]`` in the second line as the return value of ``corrcoef`` is a 2x2 matrix  1) Here is the documentation for numpy.correlate. The code inside the file looks like this: mode = _mode_from_name(mode) return multiarray.correlate(avmode) multiarray.correlate points to a .pyd file (i.e. a DLL file) so to get the inner workings you should probably ask the numpy developers. 2) If you don't believe the numpy results you might try SciPy's correlate function. The scipy and numpy correlate functions are both in C. numpy multiarray source code is somewhere in here: http://svn.scipy.org/svn/numpy/trunk/numpy/core/src/multiarray/ and scipy correlate source code is here: http://svn.scipy.org/svn/scipy/trunk/scipy/signal/correlate_nd.c.src  To answer your first question Numpy.correlate(a v mode) is performing the convolution of a with the reverse of v and giving the results clipped by the specified mode. Because of the definition of convolution the correlation C(t) = Sum for -inf < i < inf of (a[i] * v[t + i]) where -inf < t < inf. Even though this definition of the correlation would allow for results from -infinity to infinity you obviously can't store an infinitely long array. So it has to be clipped and that is where the mode comes in. There are 3 different modes: full same & valid. 'full' mode returns results for every t where both a and v have some overlap. 'same' mode returns a result with the same length as the shortest vector (a or v). 'valid' mode returns results only when a and v completely overlap each other. The documentation for Numpy.convolve gives more detail on the modes. For your second question I think Numpy.correlate is giving you the autocorrelation it is just giving you a little more as well. The autocorrelation is used to find how similar a signal or function is to itself at a certain time difference. At a time difference of 0 the auto-correlation should be the highest because the signal is identical to itself so you expected that the first element in the auto-correlation result array would be the greatest. However the correlation is not starting at a time difference of 0. It starts at a negative time difference closes to 0 and then goes positive. That is you were expecting: Autocorrelation(a) = Sum for -inf < i < inf (a[i] * v[t + i]) where 0 <= t < inf But what you got was: Autocorrelation(a) = Sum for -inf < i < inf (a[i] * v[t + i]) where -inf < t < inf What you need to do is take the last half of your correlation result and that should be the auto-correlation you are looking for. A simple python function to do that would be: def autocorr(x): result = numpy.correlate(x x mode='full') return result[result.size/2:] You will of course need error checking to make sure that x is actually a 1-d array. Also this explanation probably isn't the most mathematically rigorous. I've been throwing around infinities because the definition of convolution uses them but that doesn't necessarily apply for auto-correlation. So the theoretical portion of this explanation may be slightly wonky but hopefully the practical results are helpful. These pages on auto-correlation are pretty helpful and can give you a much better theoretical background if you don't mind wading through the notation and heavy concepts. In current builds of numpy the mode 'same' can be specified to achieve exactly what the A. Levy proposed. The body of the function could then read `return numpy.correlate(x x mode='same')` @DavidZwicker but the resultings are different! `np.correlate(xxmode='full')[len(x)//2:] != np.correlate(xxmode='same')`. For example `x = [12312]; np.correlate(xxmode='full');` {`>>> array([ 2 5 11 13 19 13 11 5 2])`} `np.correlate(xxmode='same');` {`>>> array([11 13 19 13 11])`}. The correct one is: `np.correlate(xxmode='full')[len(x)-1:];` {`>>> array([19 13 11 5 2])`} see **the first item** is **the largest one**. Note that this answer gives the unnormalized autocorrelation.  As I just ran into the same problem I would like to share a few lines of code with you. In fact there are several rather similar posts about autocorrelation in stackoverflow by now. If you define the autocorrelation as a(x L) = sum(k=0N-L-1)((xk-xbar)*(x(k+L)-xbar))/sum(k=0N-1)((xk-xbar)**2) [this is the definition given in IDL's a_correlate function and it agrees with what I see in answer 2 of question #12269834] then the following seems to give the correct results: import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # generate some data x = np.arange(0.6.120.01) y = np.sin(x) # y = np.random.uniform(size=300) yunbiased = y-np.mean(y) ynorm = np.sum(yunbiased**2) acor = np.correlate(yunbiased yunbiased ""same"")/ynorm # use only second half acor = acor[len(acor)/2:] plt.plot(acor) plt.show() As you see I have tested this with a sin curve and a uniform random distribution and both results look like I would expect them. Note that I used mode=""same"" instead of mode=""full"" as the others did.

On the other hand the following works: a[a==1] = 3 print a >>> [0 3 2 3 3] Cheers Philipp It appears you simply can't do an assignment through a double-slice like that. This works though: a[numpy.where(a==1)[0][1:]] = 3  This does what you want a[2:][a[2:]==1]=3 But that requires knowing in advance that the first occurrence of 1 is at position 1.  Because the a[a==1] part isn't actually a slice. It creates a new array. It makes sense when you think about it-- you're only taking the elements that satisfy the boolean condition (like a filter operation). @tom10 - It's not a ""hack"". It's part of the implementation of the array class. Behavior is documented for instance here: http://www.scipy.org/Tentative_NumPy_Tutorial#head-864862d3f2bb4c32f04260fac61eb4ef34788c4c. ""Slicing an array returns a view of it"" i.e. not a copy. normal list works that way too -- you can assign to slices (only with iterables) `l = range(10); l[5:] = range(5)` @Dave - Certainly a slice in numpy is a view but a[a==1] is not a slice and not a view. I added a second example that works like I expect. I don't really see the difference. Shouldn't the assignment being ""piped through""? I don't think this is quite right. If you do `a[a==1] = 3` that actually changes the contents of a. @Dave - I think this is perimosocodiae is correct and that your counter-example is due to something more like a hack in the numpy internals to create the appearance of an in-place operation.  It's related to how fancy indexing works. There is a thorough explanation here. It is done this way to allow inplace modification with fancy indexing (ie a[x>3] *= 2). A consequence of this is that you can't assign to a double index as you have found. Fancy indexing always returns a copy rather than a view. Actually your solution modifies the first occurrence of 1 which is not what he wants. Right - took it off before your comment. Ps hi Philip it's Robin! Hey Robin - what chance is that to meet here...

276254,"How to disable (or hide) the close (x) button on a JFrame? I have a window (derived from JFrame) and I want to disable the close button during certain operations which are not interruptible. I know I can make the button not do anything (or call a handler in a WindowListener) by calling setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.DO_NOTHING_ON_CLOSE); but I would like to make it clear visually that it is pointless to click it. I agree with Josh. At the very least map close to a popup that says ""Operation in Progress..."" with a ""Cancel"" (hides popup) and ""Close Anyway"" (forces quit) button. When the background operation completes the app closes if that popup is still visible (i.e. they haven't clicked Cancel) Just a suggestion you might want to consider avoiding such GUI behavior due to poor usability.

1009150,"C++/OpenGL - Rotating a rectangle For my project i needed to rotate a rectangle. I thought that would be easy but i'm getting an unpredictable behavior when running it.. Here is the code:  glPushMatrix(); glRotatef(30.0f 0.0f 0.0f 1.0f); glTranslatef(vec_vehicle_position_.x vec_vehicle_position_.y 0); glEnable(GL_TEXTURE_2D); glEnable(GL_BLEND); glBlendFunc(GL_SRC_ALPHA GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA); glBegin(GL_QUADS); glTexCoord2f(0.0f 0.0f); glVertex2f(0 0); glTexCoord2f(1.0f 0.0f); glVertex2f(width_sprite_ 0); glTexCoord2f(1.0f 1.0f); glVertex2f(width_sprite_ height_sprite_); glTexCoord2f(0.0f 1.0f); glVertex2f(0 height_sprite_); glEnd(); glDisable(GL_BLEND); glDisable(GL_TEXTURE_2D); glPopMatrix(); The problem with that is that my rectangle is making a translation somewhere in the window while rotating. In other words the rectangle doesn't keep the position : vec_vehicle_position_.x and vec_vehicle_position_.y. What's the problem ? Thanks To elaborate on the previous answers. Transformations in OpenGL are performed via matrix multiplication. In your example you have: M_r_ - the rotation transform M_t_ - the translation transform v - a vertex and you had applied them in the order: M_r_ * M_t_ * v Using parentheses to clarify: ( M_r_ * ( M_t_ * v ) ) We see that the vertex is transformed by the closer matrix first which is in this case the translation. It can be a bit counter intuitive because this requires you to specify the transformations in the order opposite of that which you want them applied in. But if you think of how the transforms are placed on the matrix stack it should hopefully make a bit more sense (the stack is pre-multiplied together). Hence why in order to get your desired result you needed to specify the transforms in the opposite order. Indeed :) Thanks for the update !  Make sure the rotation is applied before the translation.  Inertiatic provided a very good response. From a code perspective your transformations will happen in the reverse order they appear. In other words transforms closer to the actual drawing code will be applied first. For example: glRotate(); glTranslate(); glScale(); drawMyThing(); Will first scale your thing then translate it then rotate it. You effectively need to ""read your code backwards"" to figure out which transforms are being applied in which order. Also keep in mind what the state of these transforms is when you push and pop the model-view stack.  You need to flip the order of your transformations: glRotatef(30.0f 0.0f 0.0f 1.0f); glTranslatef(vec_vehicle_position_.x vec_vehicle_position_.y 0); becomes glTranslatef(vec_vehicle_position_.x vec_vehicle_position_.y 0); glRotatef(30.0f 0.0f 0.0f 1.0f); Thanks a lot it works !",c++ opengl rotation,0.9853872971238247,5.301992672494787E-4,0.013675510266189466,4.0699334273636405E-4

The selection is done natively without using openGL. But the glClipPlane applies to all openGL elements - coordinate icons gridlines etc and even elements drawn in gluOrtho2D on top - scale bars selection boxes etc. Is there anyway to selective override the clipplanes to allow these elements to be drawn while clipping the main scene?

How do I achieve this? Just iterate over one dimension then the other. for row in self.cells: for cell in row: do_something(cell) Of course with only two dimensions you can compress this down to a single loop using a list comprehension or generator expression but that's not very scalable or readable: for cell in (cell for row in self.cells for cell in row): do_something(cell) If you need to scale this to multiple dimensions and really want a flat list you can write a flatten function. Wow this answer is ancient. You're right; will fix. Isn't the way he did it fine? It's just a generator expression instead of a list comprehension...am I missing something? O.o You got it wrong. It should be: for cell in [cell for row in self.cells for cell in row]: do_something(cell) The 'for's used to be backwards. I edited it since.  It's clear you're using numpy. With numpy you can just do: for cell in self.cells.flat: do_somethin(cell)  How about this: import itertools for cell in itertools.chain(*self.cells): cell.drawCell(surface posx posy) `itertools.chain.from_iterable(self.cells)`  If you need to change the values of the individual cells then ndenumerate (in numpy) is your friend.

601477,"Best way to create a NumPy array from a dictionary? I'm just starting with NumPy so I may be missing some core concepts... What's the best way to create a NumPy array from a dictionary whose values are lists? Something like this: d = { 1: [102030]  2: [5060] 3: [100200300400500] } Should turn into something like: data = [ [102030??] [5060???] [100200300400500] ] I'm going to do some basic statistics on each row eg: deviations = numpy.std(data axis=1) Questions: What's the best / most efficient way to create the numpy.array from the dictionary? The dictionary is large; a couple of million keys each with ~20 items. The number of values for each 'row' are different. If I understand correctly numpy wants uniform size so what do I fill in for the missing items to make std() happy? Update: One thing I forgot to mention - while the python techniques are reasonable (eg. looping over a few million items is fast) it's constrained to a single CPU. Numpy operations scale nicely to the hardware and hit all the CPUs so they're attractive. numpy dictionary You can use a structured array to preserve the ability to address a numpy object by a key like a dictionary. import numpy as np dd = {'a':1'b':2'c':3} dtype = eval('[' + ''.join([""('%s' float)"" % key for key in dd.keys()]) + ']') values = [tuple(dd.values())] numpy_dict = np.array(values dtype=dtype) numpy_dict['c'] will now output array([ 3.]) However the resulting array has a nested tuple so it might be slower for some operations.  You don't need to create numpy arrays to call numpy.std(). You can call numpy.std() in a loop over all the values of your dictionary. The list will be converted to a numpy array on the fly to compute the standard variation. The downside of this method is that the main loop will be in python and not in C. But I guess this should be fast enough: you will still compute std at C speed and you will save a lot of memory as you won't have to store 0 values where you have variable size arrays. If you want to further optimize this you can store your values into a list of numpy arrays so that you do the python list -> numpy array conversion only once. if you find that this is still too slow try to use psycho to optimize the python loop. if this is still too slow try using Cython together with the numpy module. This Tutorial claims impressive speed improvements for image processing. Or simply program the whole std function in Cython (see this for benchmarks and examples with sum function ) An alternative to Cython would be to use SWIG with numpy.i. if you want to use only numpy and have everything computed at C level try grouping all the records of same size together in different arrays and call numpy.std() on each of them. It should look like the following example. example with O(N) complexity: import numpy list_size_1 = [] list_size_2 = [] for row in data.itervalues(): if len(row) == 1: list_size_1.append(row) elif len(row) == 2: list_size_2.append(row) list_size_1 = numpy.array(list_size_1) list_size_2 = numpy.array(list_size_2) std_1 = numpy.std(list_size_1 axis = 1) std_2 = numpy.std(list_size_2 axis = 1) I'm doing the numpy.std in a loop now and you're right the memory savings are important. I would like to at least do a speed comparison with the numpy version though. The problem is that numpy.std() was made to accept only fix size array. So the only way I see to do this test is to group all the records of same size together and call numpy.std() on each of them. Shouldn't CPython really be Cython? Have I got it wrong? Yes correct. Fixed. Grouping same sized records simple but effective. I like it.  While there are already some pretty reasonable ideas present here I believe following is worth mentioning. Filling missing data with any default value would spoil the statistical characteristics (std etc). Evidently that's why Mapad proposed the nice trick with grouping same sized records. The problem with it (assuming there isn't any a priori data on records lengths is at hand) is that it involves even more computations than the straightforward solution: at least O(N*logN) 'len' calls and comparisons for sorting with an effective algorithm O(N) checks on the second way through the list to obtain groups(their beginning and end indexes on the 'vertical' axis) Using Psyco is a good idea (it's strikingly easy to use so be sure to give it a try). It seems that the optimal way is to take the strategy described by Mapad in bullet #1 but with a modification - not to generate the whole list but iterate through the dictionary converting each row into numpy.array and performing required computations. Like this: for row in data.itervalues(): np_row = numpy.array(row) this_row_std = numpy.std(np_row) # compute any other statistic descriptors needed and then save to some list In any case a few million loops in python won't take as long as one might expect. Besides this doesn't look like a routine computation so who cares if it takes extra second/minute if it is run once in a while or even just once. A generalized variant of what was suggested by Mapad: from numpy import array mean std def get_statistical_descriptors(a): if ax = len(shape(a))-1 functions = [mean std] return f(a axis = ax) for f in functions def process_long_list_stats(data): import numpy groups = {} for key row in data.iteritems(): size = len(row) try: groups[size].append(key) except KeyError: groups[size] = ([key]) results = [] for gr_keys in groups.itervalues(): gr_rows = numpy.array([data[k] for k in gr_keys]) stats = get_statistical_descriptors(gr_rows) results.extend( zip(gr_keys zip(*stats)) ) return dict(results) Thanks Maleev this is essentially what I ended up doing. One thing I forgot to mention - while looping in Python is fast I believe I'm only using a single CPU with this method. Matrix operations hit all CPUs so they're attractive. Why would you need to sort the rows before grouping vectors by length? Only grouping is needed. Moreover I would be careful with the big O notation: here N ~ 1000000 but the speed between a Python and C program can be ~100 times slower. So N -> 1000 is not really tending to the infinity 2 Parand: You're right taking multi-threading into account does really make sense. 2 Mapad: If I'm not terribly mistaken grouping is essentially equivalent to sorting. How then do you suggest to group them? Python code whether it is just loop over the rows or grouping is executed in any of the cases. So talking exclusively of python code's asymptotic complexity we've got difference in p*O(NlogN) - p*O(N) = p*O(NlogN). Besides C code looping through rows inside groups adds up c*O(N) to it. You say c << p. Sure. But that still leaves that p*O(NlogN) difference. Unless you prove you can really do grouping in O(N) in average and worst case. I agree with your simplifications I just want to recall they assume N >> p (p being computation time introduced by Python loop compared to C loop to process a record). Since all process here take O(N) (see my example) I would not throw away the p with the big O notation to check complexity",python numpy,0.0024104620529814117,1.8425254672708503E-4,1.574937740859458E-4,0.9972477916262056

What's the best way to do this? For data sets with the same number of rows (which I've been forcing by chopping longer data sets short) I just do: d_avg = sum(dsets) / float(len(dsets)) where ""dsets"" is a list of the ndarrays containing the data from each CSV file. This works well but I don't want to discard the data from the longer runs. I can also resize the shorter runs to the length of the longest but all the new fields are filled with ""NoneType"". Later operations then error when adding (for example) a float and a NoneType. Any suggestions? I think the average for row 7 is wrong I knew I was going to miss one of those rows! Updated.

If it is still unclear feel free to ask; I'll try my best to explain. The trick part is getting the t-values merged. (That was done with numpy array's searchsorted method.)

I didn't know about 'loadtxt'. I was using the 'tabular' module which turned out to be overkill. Thanks.  Why not just us numpy's ma (masked array) module? maxLen = reduce(lambda ab : max(a b.shape[0]) dSets 0) all = N.ma.zeros((maxLen)+ dSets[0].shape[1:] + (len(dSets)) dtype=float) # set the dtype to whatever all.mask = True for i set in enumerate(dSets): all.mask[:len(set)...i] = False all[:len(set)...i] = set mean = all.mean(axis=-1) Of course this only works if you can guarantee that the time in each row is the same across all arrays i.e. set[i0] == set[j0] for all ij This works great. Thanks! One thing: the reduce/lambda construct can fail when an early value is the highest: 'int' has no method 'shape'. replaced with: maxLen = max([a.shape[0] for a in dSets]) Yes you're right I ballsed up the lambda. Edited to correct. Cheers! Even if the time isn't the same you can use masked arrays. You just need to be smarter in setting up the masked array so the data for each time is in the same row.  Well one way to do it would be to iterate over each row of each data set and append a given column value to an array that's stored in a dictionary where the time index is used for its key value. You then iterate over the dictionary and pull the average for each array stored there. This isn't particularly efficient -- the other option is to find the longest array iterate over it and query the other datasets to create an temporary array to average. This way you save the secondary iteration over the dictionary. I was really hoping that numpy with its array-oriented efficiency would provide a way to do exactly that. You're right though I'll have to fall back to the method you suggest if there's no existing operation for it. If you're really wanting to stay in numpy take a look at masked arrays here: http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/maskedarray.generic.html It's not so much numpy itself that I want. It's clean easy-to-understand code! Frankly I'd drop Python for (hypothetically) R if that meant an elegant solution. But I know even less about R than numpy. Thanks for the tip on masked arrays.

Since the aglUseFont is now deprecated I'm looking for another way to add text as well as be able to query the glyph properties (i.e. width height spacing etc) So far I've investigated CoreText and ATSUI but both without much luck. Please help me!! Thanks! You could take a look at the FreeType project: it's an open source portable font rendering engine that supports OpenType TrueType Postscript Type 1 and other formats. There are several open source integrations of FreeType with OpenGL; see for example OGLFT. Or you could just roll your own: it's not hard to make FreeType generate bitmaps in some suitable pixel format and then pass these bitmaps to glTexImage2D.  In the end I just went with good old glBitmap for my fonts. Found an apple dev sample that created rendered each character and got its pertinent info (width height offset etc.) However if I get the time to do some more work on it later I plan on using the FreeType project as was suggested above.

496233,"What are your best Swing design patterns and tips? I'm writing a GUI for an application using Swing and in the interests of code maintenance and readability I want to follow a consistent pattern throughout the whole system. Most of the articles and books (or at least book sections) that I've read appear to provide plenty of examples on how to create and arrange various components but ignore the bigger picture of writing a full GUI. What are your best tips for application GUI design and what patterns do you follow when designing or refactoring a GUI application? here are my four babys : http://blue-walrus.com/swing-design-patterns/ Make heavy use of the MVC pattern. Here's a simple example of what I mean: class Person { String firstName; String lastName; // and getters and setters... } class PersonSwingModel { private Person person; private javax.swing.text.PlainDocument firstName; private javax.swing.text.PlainDocument lastName; // and getters and setters... // Create some method like init() that initializes PlainDocument values // to attributes in model. } class SavePersonAction extends AbstractAction { private PersonSwingModel model; // and getters and setters... } class PersonSwingView extends JFrame { private PersonSwingModel model; private javax.swing.JTextField firstName; private javax.swing.JTextField lastName; private SavePersonAction savePersonAction; // hook up to JButton/JMenuItem // and getters and setters... // Create some method like init() which binds PlainDocument to JTextField // and Actions to JButtons or JMenuItems } I see some people disagree with extending JFrame or JPanel. I don't. Works for me. Also use LayoutManagers. GridBagLayout is very powerful. If you use it define some GridBagConstraints constants (like LABEL_GBC and FIELD_GBC) and keep reusing them.  I think a good working knowledge of concurrency is often understated. You really need to be familiar with Swing's threading policy and general synchronization techniques to build a responsive GUI and an efficient backend.  Definitely put the GUI in one class and the logic in another class or multiple classes -- to the greatest extent possible. If you use the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern this will happen automatically. If you don't do this the GUI will quickly become unmaintainably complicated.  Avoid inherit when composition would be easier. For instance I have seen a lot like this: public class CustomerSupportApp extends JFrame { JList<Customer> customers; OtherBusinessComponent importantComponent; etc. etc } This is mixing business logic with presentation. It only makes changes from difficult to impossible. Better is: public class CustomerSupportApp { JList<Customer> customers; OtherBusinessComponent importantComponent; // The app HAS-A frame but not IS-A frame JFrame frame; etc. etc } In your case it is obvious because application != frame but there are other examples e.g. `FooFrame extends BarFrame` where inheritance also is not appropriate e.g. because they have too less in common.  Karsten Lentzsch's JGoodies has been very helpful to me for architectural design especially with regard to the Presentation Model pattern bindings and validation. Check out his articles and libraries. Use an MVC-like pattern. I say ""like"" because the goal is really to separate the view from the model not to conform to a specific flavor of MVC. I prefer using Presentation Model myself. MiGLayout - I use it for everything unless a basic layout manager will do. Modularize and reuse as much as you can. WindowBuilder Pro for Eclipse - The best visual designer because it works with existing/edited code and doesn't lock you in. And it's free now! I have no issue with using designers because the view should be separate from the rest of the code. Netbeans Platform (RCP) - The only real Swing framework. I hope to learn and use this when I have time because part of a framework's job is to address concerns like yours. JavaBuilders - Cool project that allows declarative UIs but I'm not sure it's mature enough to risk it especially with an existing project. However it's interesting to read their PDF book if only to understand the problems they're trying to solve.  Avoid using GUI layout designers (builders). Later on it will make your code much cleaner and easier to maintain. It's true that if you start your GUI with a builder you are pretty much committed to using that builder throughout the whole life of the GUI. This is sometimes acceptable sometimes not. Yes it's true. Different builders store metadata in different formats which are not mutually compatibel. The only exception is Instantiations Swing Designer which works with the code directly. All of them create code which is not meant to be edited by hand (unreadable) which will bite you later. I disagree. If you know Swing well any code generated by a GUI builder will be readable enough. Problem is that by using a GUI builder you will not get to know Swing well. Good separation is of course necessary. WindowBuilder Pro does a good job with generated code. Check it out: https://developers.google.com/java-dev-tools/wbpro/?hl=fr  Get into the habit of having your callbacks spawn off threads to do the actual work and then you won't be having frozen GUIs when one of your callbacks turns into a time consuming monster. Better yet use SwingWorker. Yes SwingWorker is one of many ways to spawn off a thread. Dont forget SwingUtilities invoker later if that thread needs to update the GUI afterwards :) Take a look at FoxTrot: http://foxtrot.sourceforge.net/  I think that the main problem you are going to be faced with is testability of your gui application. So regarding maintainability and ease of unit testing I am leaning towards the ""Presenter first"" idiom instead of Model View Controller (MVC) and other derivatives that instruct you to have the view knowing of the actual application logic (Model). The best resource is the web site of the group that introduced it as a thought. Since using an approach like that is going to take a lot of boilerplate code to initialize the various elements of your application I would also suggest in using a dependency injection framework. I have settled with Guice.  Avoid spawning too many threads when user clicks action button multiple times. Disable button on first click spawn your action in background thread and when done enable button again. This may not be problem for short running tasks.  Try not to code the text into your app. Swing guis can be pretty easily written to be data driven consider defining your GUI in an xml file (including the component names and positions/layout attributes). I worked on systems that had a LOT of property sheets (which are just piles of controls page after page of them)--without making it data driven it's virtually impossible to maintain or internationalize. If you decide to use a GUI builder never modify the code it outputs if you can possibly avoid it--it's better to bind to the GUI from an external class. Think about what will happen if you have to do it without the builder--will it be difficult to port? Impossible? Understand the gotchas in swing--only modifying GUI components from the AWT thread returning the AWT thread as quickly as possible (spawn a new thread if you have to do anything that takes over 100ms) Try your best to keep your code DRY--It can be a real programming challenge with Swing GUIs--Again data driven code is the only way I've found to not constantly repeat code like new JButton(""...""); If your data is property-sheet based seriously consider creating a binding mechanism to tie your controls to your data. A good goal for DRY code would be 0 (ZERO) control-specific lines of code per control to get a piece of data from your database to your GUI have the user edit it and get it back to your DB. This means that you should be able to add a new control by doing nothing but modifying your data.  Have a look at the application framework API ( https://appframework.dev.java.net/ and http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/javase/swingappfr/. It's a great API to build your swing application. e.g. : all the styles (color fonticons...) are defined in a simple config file.  mvc is your friend.  This is a more abstract high-level answer about what your GUI represents not the mechanics of it.. Depending on your task it may be kind of difficult to make it so your user can conceptually grasp what the GUI is doing. I've done some pretty tricky work involving GUIs and my most successful approaches have been those that took a complex set of controls and put them into a layout that the user expected. For instance I wrote a system to manage 2 devices one at either end of a T1 line (kinda like modems). The controls were really hard to comprehend--fields like ""create loopback test far end signal test near end bit patterns sending various bit patterns ..."" (this is a huge oversimplification it was a lot worse than this) I had to really understand the problem so I went to a Tech Support rep who helped customers with this problem all the time. He showed me a diagram in the manual and stepped me through what the different controls did on that diagram. I took the diagram re-created it using graphics (just a simple line-drawing for the most part but it showed both ends and the connections between them) then used regions of the graphics to represent controls AND feedback (color changes). You could visually see that a signal was going out. When you turned on a loopback at the far end you could see that the line looped the signal back to it's outgoing line then you could see the color change as your near-end started getting the pattern that it was sending out it's other line. The ""Controls"" were significantly more convoluted than this but the GUI reduced it to EXACTLY what the customer needed to understand the problem. After this we had customers coming back to us telling us that they had never been able to figure this stuff out before but now they totally get it! This presentation was infinitely more important than the wiring of the GUI implementation.  Never derive from JDialog JFrame or JInternalFrame for defining your forms dialogs... Rather derive from JPanel. This will bring you the follwing advantages: possibility to later change from a JFrame to a JDialog for instance (because user changed his mind) you can reuse one panel instance from one JDialog to another (JDialog are generally not reusable because they are constructed with a reference to their ""parent"" a frame or another dialog) you can later on change replace JDialog with a more functional subclass from a 3rd-party framework. Along with this I would define a 'view' interface. What should your 'view' interface do?  Use layout managers. You might think it's simpler just to position everything with hard coded positions now (especially if you use a graphical layout tool) but when it comes time to update the gui or internationalize it your successors will hate you. (Trust me on this I was the guy saying to use the layout managers from the start and the successor to the guy who ignored me.)  You're not supposed to extend JFrame JDialog JPanel JButton Janything classes (although certain extensions to table behaviour are only available if you extend it). You can extend JComponent if you feel like doing custom component. If are supposed to implement models (e.g. by extending abstract models) listeners (e.g. by extending adapters) but that's it. You don't need/have to extend swing components usually and you better not do it as it makes your code tied to implementation of superclass.",java gui design-patterns swing,7.562592505428253E-5,0.9612780908779706,0.03855161083112685,9.467236584829948E-5
1822417,Simple question about numpy matrix in python Let's suppose I have a numpy matrix variable called MATRIX with 3 coordinates: (x y z). Is acessing the matrix's value through the following code myVar = MATRIX[000] equal to myVar = MATRIX[00][0] or myVar = MATRIX[0][00] ? What about if I have the following code? myTuple = (00) myScalar = 0 myVar = MATRIX[myTuple myScalar] Is the last line equivalent to doing myVar = MATRIX[myTuple[0] myTuple[1] myScalar] I have done simple tests and it seems so but maybe that is not so in all the cases. How do square brackets work in python with numpy matrices? Since day one I felt confused as how they work. Thanks Are you sure? I get a `TypeError` when I try any of this. If you have a tuple `MYTUPLE=(123)` then the only possible indices are `MYTUPLE[0]` `MYTUPLE[1]` and `MYTUPLE[2]`. Sorry now that I see it it's numpy matrices that I was refering to. It's not possible to index a tuple with another tuple so none of that code is valid.  I assume you have a array instance rather than a matrix since the latter only can have two dimensions. m[0 0 0] gets the element at position (0 0 0). m[0 0] gets a whole subarray (a slice) which is itself a array. You can get the first element of this subarray like this: m[0 0][0] which is why both syntaxes work (even though m[i j k] is preferred because it doesn't have the unnecessary intermediate step).

1823927,"Simulated time in a game loop using c++ I am building a 3d game from scratch in C++ using OpenGL and SDL on linux as a hobby and to learn more about this area of programming. Wondering about the best way to simulate time while the game is running. Obviously I have a loop that looks something like: void main_loop() { while(!quit) { handle_events(); DrawScene(); ... SDL_Delay(time_left()); } } I am using the SDL_Delay and time_left() to maintain a framerate of about 33 fps. I had thought that I just need a few global variables like int current_hour = 0; int current_min = 0; int num_days = 0; Uint32 prev_ticks = 0; Then a function like : void handle_time() { Uint32 current_ticks; Uint32 dticks; current_ticks = SDL_GetTicks(); dticks = current_ticks - prev_ticks; // get difference since last time // if difference is greater than 30000 (half minute) increment game mins if(dticks >= 30000) { prev_ticks = current_ticks; current_mins++; if(current_mins >= 60) { current_mins = 0; current_hour++; } if(current_hour > 23) { current_hour = 0; num_days++; } } } and then call the handle_time() function in the main loop. It compiles and runs (using printf to write the time to the console at the moment) but I am wondering if this is the best way to do it. Is there easier ways or more efficient ways? ""just need a few global variables"" - don't. There are nearly always better alternatives e.g. a `struct` wich contains the information and gets passed around. What exactly are you trying to do? I haven't tried SDL but will the ticks be dependent on the processor rate or is it always locked to milliseconds? You want to have a simulated minute every 30 seconds? SDL_GetTicks -- Gets the number of milliseconds since SDL library initialization. Based on this I am trying to simulate a minute every 30 seconds. Global state like time which is used by everything everywhere really ought to be in a global variable. Otherwise you'd have to pass your ""current time and framecount"" struct to every single function in the entire game. That assumes the entire game needs the current time and framecount which I'm pretty sure it doesn't. In my experience I get the time in the main loop and pass it to the update function that's it. Few places really need this data. I have the opposite experience. We use gpGlobals->currenttime absolutely everywhere: in the particle systems AI behavior speech special effects trigger hysteresis weapon fire rates (and projectile movement) animation scripting on and on. I grepped just now and found 4707 uses in one game DLL alone. Other than the issues already pointed out (you should use a structure for the times and pass it to handle_time() and your minute will get incremented every half minute) your solution is fine for keeping track of time running in the game. However for most game events that need to happen every so often you should probably base them off of the main game loop instead of an actual time so they will happen in the same proportions with a different fps.  I am not a Linux developer but you might want to have a look at using Timers instead of polling for the ticks. http://linux.die.net/man/2/timer_create EDIT: SDL Seem to support Timers: SDL_SetTimer If you look at the handle_time() function it's clear that he's not just counting minutes and hours for the fps ( which is handled by DrawScene()). As far as I understand he wanted to keep a ""clock"" in the game. I accept your comment performance in game development and I won't argue with you here as it's not my field.But as an idea for a different implementation I don't think there was anything fundamentally wrong with my answer While good advice in general this is not a good idea for game development. Not even for displaying the time in the game like he does ? Do you actually use polling instead ? zildjohn01: why are timers are a bad idea for a game? I am assuming they have some sort of performance impact? This is bad because you don't want a game to have a callback that does something every (n) milliseconds -- some frames might finish a little ahead of 33 and some others might lag behind. If you have a frame that takes 37 milliseconds and then set the next frame for 33 after that then you'll be effectively slowing down time as your two frames (representing 66ms of game time) would take place over 70ms of real time. It's much better to have the game loop running at full speed all the time -- never sleeping or pausing -- and use a high-resolution realtime clock to mark constant timesteps. I never suggested handling the frames with a timer. He was asking about Time. That's why he wanted the time: ""I am using the SDL_Delay and time_left() to maintain a framerate of about 33 fps.""  One of Glenn's posts you will really want to read is Fix Your Timestep!. After looking up this link I noticed that Mads directed you to the same general place in his answer.  I've mentioned this before in other game related threads. As always follow the suggestions by Glenn Fiedler in his Game Physics series What you want to do is to use a constant timestep which you get by accumulating time deltas. If you want 33 updates per second then your constant timestep should be 1/33. You could also call this the update frequency. You should also decouple the game logic from the rendering as they don't belong together. You want to be able to use a low update frequency while rendering as fast as the machine allows. Here is some sample code: running = true; unsigned int t_accum=0lt=0ct=0; while(running){ while(SDL_PollEvent(&event)){ switch(event.type){ ... } } ct = SDL_GetTicks(); t_accum += ct - lt; lt = ct; while(t_accum >= timestep){ t += timestep; /* this is our actual time in milliseconds. */ t_accum -= timestep; for(std::vector<Entity>::iterator en = entities.begin(); en != entities.end(); ++en){ integrate(en (float)t * 0.001f timestep); } } /* This should really be in a separate thread synchronized with a mutex */ std::vector<Entity> tmpEntities(entities.size()); for(int i=0; i<entities.size(); ++i){ float alpha = (float)t_accum / (float)timestep; tmpEntities[i] = interpolateState(entities[i].lastState alpha entities[i].currentState 1.0f - alpha); } Render(tmpEntities); } This handles undersampling as well as oversampling. If you use integer arithmetic like done here your game physics should be close to 100% deterministic no matter how slow or fast the machine is. This is the advantage of increasing the time in fixed time intervals. The state used for rendering is calculated by interpolating between the previous and current states where the leftover value inside the time accumulator is used as the interpolation factor. This ensures that the rendering is is smooth no matter how large the timestep is. This is essentially what we do (in our commercial product). We run our game logic at a constant timestep of 10hz but let the rendering thread run as fast as possible and draw frames as quickly as the GPU is ready for them. This means that physics and AI and entity logic isn't impacted by render speed (otherwise the world would go into slow-time when the rendering bogged down). The rendering isn't on a constant timestep it just goes as fast as it can (up to 60hz of course). @Crashworks : Exactly. You don't care about a fixed timestep for the rendering. It would make the rendering choppy. One can make the case that there *should* be a constant rendering timestep too since a variable framerate feels choppier than a consistent one and because the monitor is updating at 30/60hz (or 25/50 for PAL) so any frame that isn't aligned with a vsync interval will ""tear"" in the middle of the screen. It's very subjective though so we made ""wait for vsync"" a customer-settable option. Hah NTSC vs PAL differences was actually the reason why SEGA Genesis games for European consoles ran faster than North American ones. So even game consoles suffered from this issue though less than PC games from the same era. @Mads In which part of the above code (integrate or interpolate) is collision detection done?",c++ opengl sdl,0.5398377480948056,0.2791939373847088,1.567734065285487E-4,0.180811541113957
560283,"How do you construct an array suitable for numpy sorting? I need to sort two arrays simultaneously or rather I need to sort one of the arrays and bring the corresponding element of its associated array with it as I sort. That is if the array is [(5 33) (4 44) (3 55)] and I sort by the first axis (labeled below dtype='alpha') then I want: [(3.0 55.0) (4.0 44.0) (5.0 33.0)]. These are really big data sets and I need to sort first ( for nlog(n) speed ) before I do some other operations. I don't know how to merge my two separate arrays though in the proper manner to get the sort algorithm working. I think my problem is rather simple. I tried three different methods: import numpy x=numpy.asarray([543]) y=numpy.asarray([334455]) dtype=[('alpha'float) ('beta'float)] values=numpy.array([(x)(y)]) values=numpy.rollaxis(values1) #values = numpy.array(values dtype=dtype) #a=numpy.array(valuesdtype=dtype) #q=numpy.sort(aorder='alpha') print ""Try 1:\n"" values values=numpy.empty((len(x)2)) for n in range (len(x)): values[n][0]=y[n] values[n][1]=x[n] print ""Try 2:\n"" values #values = numpy.array(values dtype=dtype) #a=numpy.array(valuesdtype=dtype) #q=numpy.sort(aorder='alpha') ### values = [(x[0] y[0]) (x[1]y[1])  (x[2]y[2])] print ""Try 3:\n"" values values = numpy.array(values dtype=dtype) a=numpy.array(valuesdtype=dtype) q=numpy.sort(aorder='alpha') print ""Result:\n""q I commented out the first and second trys because they create errors I knew the third one would work because that was mirroring what I saw when I was RTFM. Given the arrays x and y (which are very large just examples shown) how do I construct the array (called values) that can be called by numpy.sort properly? *** Zip works great thanks. Bonus question: How can I later unzip the sorted data into two arrays again? I think you just need to specify the axis that you are sorting on when you have made your final ndarray. Alternatively argsort one of the original arrays and you'll have an index array that you can use to look up in both x and y which might mean you don't need values at all. (scipy.org seems to be unreachable right now or I would post you a link to some docs) Given that your description doesn't quite match your code snippet it's hard to say with certainty but I think you have over-complicated the creation of your numpy array.  I couldn't get a working solution using Numpy's sort function but here's something else that works: import numpy x = [543] y = [334455] r = numpy.asarray([(x[i]y[i]) for i in numpy.lexsort([x])]) lexsort returns the permutation of the array indices which puts the rows in sorted order. If you wanted your results sorted on multiple keys e.g. by x and then by y use numpy.lexsort([xy]) instead.  Simon suggested argsort as an alternative approach; I'd recommend it as the way to go. No messy merging zipping or unzipping: just access by index. idx = numpy.argsort(x) ans = [ (x[idx[i]]y[idx[i]]) for i in idx]  for your bonus question -- zip actually unzips too: In [1]: a = range(10) In [2]: b = range(10 20) In [3]: c = zip(a b) In [4]: c Out[4]: [(0 10) (1 11) (2 12) (3 13) (4 14) (5 15) (6 16) (7 17) (8 18) (9 19)] In [5]: d e = zip(*c) In [6]: d e Out[6]: ((0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9) (10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19))  zip() might be inefficient for large arrays. numpy.dstack() could be used instead of zip: ndx = numpy.argsort(x) values = numpy.dstack((x[ndx] y[ndx])) it actually turns out np.take(xndx) is faster than fancy indexing. [http://wesmckinney.com/blog/?p=215](http://wesmckinney.com/blog/?p=215) @user545424: looks interesting. thanks for the link thankyou as far as I can tell this is the fastest answer given (I haven't done any speed tests but I really doubt that building a zip and then unzipping it is the fastest)  I think what you want is the zip function. If you have x = [123] y = [456] then zip(xy) == [(14)(25)(36)] So your array could be constructed using a = numpy.array(zip(xy) dtype=dtype) +1: zip works well with generators so you don't have to create giant in-memory lists you can use generator functions instead.

Yes but it's just a mall part I can't solve. The whole homework will be a ray tracer and this structure stores the screen pixels. Uh ... Since you're allocating each single pixel with a separate malloc() you will have to draw each pixel with a separate call to glDrawPixels() too. This is (obviously) insane; the idea of bitmapped graphics is that the pixels are stored in an adjacent compact format so that it is quick and fast (O(1)) to move from one pixel to another. This looks very confused to me. A more sensible approach would be to allocate the ""3D array"" (which is often referred to as a 2D array of pixels where each pixel happens to consist of a red green and blue component) with a single call to malloc() like so (in C): float *array3d; array3d = malloc(scene.camera.hres * scene.camera.vres * 3 * sizeof *array3d);  Thanks unwind.

154730,"Capturing video out of an OpenGL window in Windows I am supposed to provide my users a really simple way of capturing video clips out of my OpenGL application's main window. I am thinking of adding buttons and/or keyboard shortcuts for starting and stopping the capture; when starting I could ask for a filename and other options if any. It has to run in Windows (XP/Vista) but I also wouldn't like to close the Linux door which I've so far been able to keep open. The application uses OpenGL fragment and shader programs the effects due to which I absolutely need to have in the eventual videos. It looks to me like there might be even several different approaches that could potentially fulfill my requirements (but I don't really know where I should start): An encoding library with functions like startRecording(filename) stopRecording and captureFrame. I could call captureFrame() after every frame rendered (or every second/third/whatever). If doing so makes my program run slower it's not really a problem. A standalone external program that can be programmatically controlled from my application. After all a standalone program that can not be controlled almost does what I need... But as said it should be really simple for the users to operate and I would appreciate seamlessness as well; my application typically runs full-screen. Additionally it should be possible to distribute as part of the installation package for my application which I currently prepare using NSIS. Use the Windows API to capture screenshots frame-by-frame then employ (for example) one of the libraries mentioned here. It seems to be easy enough to find examples of how to capture screenshots in Windows; however I would love a solution which doesn't really force me to get my hands super-dirty on the WinAPI level. Use OpenGL to render into an offscreen target then use a library to produce the video. I don't know if this is even possible and I'm afraid it might not be the path of least pain anyway. In particular I would not like the actual rendering to take a different execution path depending on whether video is being captured or not. Additionally I would avoid anything that might decrease the frame rate in the normal non-capture mode. If the solution were free in either sense of the word then that would be great but it's not really an absolute requirement. In general the less bloat there is the better. On the other hand for reasons beyond this question I cannot link in any GPL-only code unfortunately. Regarding the file format I cannot expect my users to start googling for any codecs but as long as also displaying the videos is easy enough for a basic-level Windows user I don't really care what the format is. However it would be great if it were possible to control the compression quality of the output. Just to clarify: I don't need to capture video from an external device like camcorder nor am I really interested in mouse movements even though getting them does not harm either. There are no requirements regarding audio; the application makes no noise whatsoever. I write C++ using Visual Studio 2008 for this very application also taking benefit of GLUT and GLUI. I have a solid understanding regarding C++ and linking in libraries and that sort of stuff but on the other hand OpenGL is quite new for me: so far I've really only learnt the necessary bits to actually get my job done. I don't need a solution super-urgently so feel free to take your time :) I had to create a demo project of recording an OpenGL rendering into a video. I used glReadPixels to get the pixel data and created the video with OpenCV's cvWriteFrame. OpenCV lets you write in divx or even x264/vp8(with ffmpeg compiled in). I have a more detailed writeup on my blog post along with a sample project. http://tommy.chheng.com/2013/09/09/encode-opengl-to-video-with-opencv/ Hi bluefeet the essential part of the answer is present: ""use glReadPixels to get the pixel data"" and use OpenCV's ""cvWriteFrame"". The blog post goes into more detail but that's the gist of the answer. Thanks for posting your answer! Please note that you should post the essential parts of the answer here on this site or your post risks being deleted [See the FAQ where it mentions answers that are 'barely more than a link'.](http://stackoverflow.com/faq#deletion) You may still include the link if you wish but only as a 'reference'. The answer should stand on its own without needing the link.  The easiest option is going to be saving each rendered frame from within your app and then merging them into an AVI. When you have the AVI there are many libraries available that can convert it into a more optimal format or possibly skip the AVI step altogether. In terms of getting each frame you could accomplish this either by rendering into an offscreen texture as you suggest or using the backbuffer directly as a source if your hardware supports this. Doing either of these (and saving each frame) is going to be difficult without a heavy penalty on framerate. Providing your application is deterministic you could ""record"" the users actions as a series of inputs and then have an export mode that sequentially renders these to an offscreen surface to generate the AVI. The frame rate penalty is quite acceptable as long as it applies only when really capturing a video. The app is deterministic in the sense of not being stochastic but what gets displayed is based in addition to user actions also on results from an external measurement device.  There are two different questions here - how to grab frames from an OpenGL application and how to turn them into a movie file. The first question is easy enough; you just grab each frame with glReadPixels() (via a PBO if you need the performance). The second question is a little harder since the cross-platform solutions (ffmpeg) tend to be GPL'd or LGPL'd. Is LGPL acceptable for your project? The Windows way of doing this (DirectShow) is a bit of a headache to use. Edit: Since LGPL is ok and you can use ffmpeg see here for an example of how to encode video. Yes: LGPL is ok. glReadPixels() indeed seems to be what I need for the first question thanks! @MikeF: that link is bust  This does look pretty relevant for merging into an AVI (as suggested by Andrew) however I was really hoping to avoid the LPBITMAPINFOHEADERs etc. Thanks for the answers I will report on the success if there is going to be any :) In the meantime additional tips for encoding the raw frames from glReadPixels into video clips would be appreciated. Edit: So far ffmpeg suggested by Mike F seems to be the way to go. However I didn't get into the actual implementation yet but hopefully that will change in the near future!

1764859,How to compute laplacian of a field? I'm trying to compute the laplacian of a 2d field A using scipy.ndimage.convolve. stencil = numpy.array([[0 1 0][1 -4 1] [0 1 0]]) scipy.ndimage.convolve(A stencil mode='wrap') This doesn't seem to give me the right answer though. Any ideas where I'm going wrong or are there better ways of computing the laplacian in numpy? how does it seem not right ? do you have an example image to compare to ? I'm testing this out on a gaussian in 2d. So I have an array where I've evaluated the laplacian of the gaussian analytically and then I try my numerical laplacian on the gaussian itself. When I take the difference between the two the results are not close to 0. i seem to remember that a convolution with a laplace kernel is only an approximation of a laplace transform... By laplacian I mean: d^2(phi)/dx^2 + d^2(phi)/dy^2. The stencil I used is supposed to be a finite difference approximation to the laplacian. did you try another laplace convolution kernel like [[111][1-81][111]] ? Just tried it and it also doesn't seem to work.  I got another idea: did you take into account that your stencil in order to approximate the Laplacian should be divided by step**2 where step is the step size of your grid? Only then can you compare the ndimage.convolve result with the analytical result. In fact with a Gaussian I obtain results that indicate that ndimage.convolve works quite well: from scipy import ndimage stencil = numpy.array([[0 1 0][1 -4 1] [0 1 0]]) x = linspace(-10 10 100) y = linspace(-10 10 100) xx yy = meshgrid(x y) image = exp(-xx**2-yy**2) # Standard deviation in x or y: 1/sqrt(2) laplaced = ndimage.convolve(image stencil)/(x[1]-x[0])**2 # stencil from original post expected_result = -4*image + 8*(xx**2+yy**2)*image # Very close to laplaced in most points! I did actually take that into account when I worked with the result matrix. I think the problem I was seeing was that the grid I was using was too small.  I tried your example and it does work with the latest SciPy on my machine. I would suggest that you plot image-ndimage.convolve(��_) in order to see how the convolution changes your image. Example: image = vstack(arange(-10 10)**2 for _ in range(20)) ndimage.convolve(image stencil mode='wrap') yields array([[-38 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2...) which is quite correct (the second order derivative of x**2 being 2)���except for the left border. I get the same result and in 1d this works for the gaussian but the 2d gaussian still doesn't work for me.,python numpy scipy,3.582737810846965E-4,5.842777862340889E-4,4.994238359423513E-4,0.9985580245967388
221386,"Removing a sequence of characters from a large binary file using python I would like to trim long sequences of the same value from a binary file in python. A simple way of doing it is simply reading in the file and using re.sub to replace the unwanted sequence. This will of course not work on large binary files. Can it be done in something like numpy? You need to make your question more precise. Do you know the values you want to trim ahead of time? Assuming you do I would probably search for the matching sections using subprocess to run ""fgrep -o -b <search string>"" and then change the relevant sections of the file using the python file object's seek read and write methods.  AJMayorga suggestion is fine unless the sizes of the replacement strings are different. Or the replacement string is at the end of the chunk. I fixed it like this: def ReplaceSequence(inFilename outFilename oldSeq newSeq): inputFile = open(inFilename ""rb"") outputFile = open(outFilename ""wb"") data = """" chunk = 1024 oldSeqLen = len(oldSeq) while 1: data = inputFile.read(chunk) dataSize = len(data) seekLen= dataSize - data.rfind(oldSeq) - oldSeqLen if seekLen > oldSeqLen: seekLen = oldSeqLen data = data.replace(oldSeq newSeq) outputFile.write(data) inputFile.seek(-seekLen 1) outputFile.seek(-seekLen 1) if dataSize < chunk: break inputFile.close() outputFile.close()  dbr's solution is a good idea but a bit overly complicated all you really have to do is rewind the file pointer the length of the sequence you are searching for before you read your next chunk. def ReplaceSequence(inFilename outFilename oldSeq newSeq): inputFile = open(inFilename ""rb"") outputFile = open(outFilename ""wb"") data = """" chunk = 1024 while 1: data = inputFile.read(chunk) data = data.replace(oldSeq newSeq) outputFile.write(data) inputFile.seek(-len(oldSequence) 1) outputFile.seek(-len(oldSequence) 1) if len(data) < chunk: break inputFile.close() outputFile.close()  If two copies fit in memory then you can easily make a copy. The second copy is the compressed version. Sure you can use numpy but you can also use the array package. Additionally you can treat your big binary object as a string of bytes and manipulate it directly. It sounds like your file may be REALLY large and you can't fit two copies into memory. (You didn't provide a lot of details so this is just a guess.) You'll have to do your compression in chunks. You'll read in a chunk do some processing on that chunk and write it out. Again numpy array or simple string of bytes will work fine.  This generator-based version will keep exactly one character of the file content in memory at a time. Note that I am taking your question title quite literally - you want to reduce runs of the same character to a single character. For replacing patterns in general this does not work: import StringIO def gen_chars(stream): while True: ch = stream.read(1) if ch: yield ch else: break def gen_unique_chars(stream): lastchar = '' for char in gen_chars(stream): if char != lastchar: yield char lastchar=char def remove_seq(infile outfile): for ch in gen_unique_chars(infile): outfile.write(ch) # Represents a file open for reading infile = StringIO.StringIO(""1122233333444555"") # Represents a file open for writing outfile = StringIO.StringIO() # Will print ""12345"" remove_seq(infile outfile) outfile.seek(0) print outfile.read()  If you don't have the memory to do open(""big.file"").read() then numpy wont really help.. It uses the same memory as python variables do (if you have 1GB of RAM you can only load 1GB of data into numpy) The solution is simple - read the file in chunks.. f = open(""big.file"" ""rb"") then do a series of f.read(500) remove the sequence and write it back out to another file object. Pretty much how you do file reading/writing in C.. The problem then is if you miss the pattern you are replacing.. For example: target_seq = ""567"" input_file = ""1234567890"" target_seq.read(5) # reads 12345 doesn't contain 567 target_seq.read(5) # reads 67890 doesn't contain 567 The obvious solution is to start at the first character in the file check len(target_seq) characters then go forward one character check forward again. For example (pseudo code!): while cur_data != """": seek_start = 0 chunk_size = len(target_seq) input_file.seek(offset = seek_start whence = 1) #whence=1 means seek from start of file (0 + offset) cur_data = input_file.read(chunk_size) # reads 123 if target_seq == cur_data: # Found it! out_file.write(""replacement_string"") else: # not it shove it in the new file out_file.write(cur_data) seek_start += 1 It's not exactly the most efficient way but it will work and not require keeping a copy of the file in memory (or two).

1302025,Game engine map editor. SDL->wxWidgets I have been writing an OpenGL game engine for a while which uses SDL for all the window management and for portability. I would like to create a level editor using the full engine. The engine itself isn't at all tied in with SDL except for input. I would like to use wxWidgets for the GUI and I have been looking at some OpenGL samples which are quite simple and easy to understand. Would it be simpler to try and integrate SDL with wxWidgets and use both or switch between them for use in different applications? What would be the best way to switch between the two systems? In all likelihood it would be easier to use one GUI API per application as opposed to merging the two together (i.e. easier to have SDL/OpenGL in your game and wxWidgets/OpenGL in your level editor). Usually these libraries are not built to be merged together or used in conjunction with other libraries so it would be nearly impossible to use them both in one program. For example I don't know much about SDL but a correctly-written wxWidgets program uses internal macros to generate int main() and start up its message pump among other things. If SDL required you to do the same thing (run some special initialization code in your int main() or allow SDL to generate its own int main()) you would be unable to initialize SDL properly without breaking wxWidgets and vice versa. Again I don't know if this particular conflict actually exists between the two libraries but it's just an example of how the two can interact and interfere with each other. That said in a perfect world it would be better to choose one of the libraries and use it both for your engine and level editor (i.e. use SDL/OpenGL for the engine and editor or wxWidgets/OpenGL for the engine and editor) but if you're happy maintaining two different API codebases then if it ain't broke don't fix it. SDL doesn't use a main() macro and can be initialized in parts but I'd guess that the message loops would overlap. (SDL requires you to implement your own loop.) Yeah if not at int main() then at the message loop will there be issues. wxWidgets creates its own native message loop completely hidden from the end-user; modifying it even slightly would easily break the library.,c++ opengl wxwidgets sdl,0.5761513310481143,0.4228497991819891,5.26262317714545E-4,4.726074521820428E-4

This will involve starting a thread and having to deal with synchronization as well as invokeLater() to get events back on the EventQueue. Is there a very simple way to do what I want? I hope I am just not seeing the API to do it. There is no simple way. I think what you outlined with a thread doing timed sleeps and polling the button is the only way. I went with the java.swing.Timer since it will automatically post back to the Swing EventQueue and that is what I am looking for. Thanks for the help.

1105349,C++ OpenGL Window and Context creation framework / library I'm searching for an multi platform OpenGL framework that abstracts the creation of windows and gl contexts in C++. I'd like to have an OO representation of Window Context & co where i can instantiate a Window create a Context and maybe later set the window to fullscreen. I'm thinking about implementing this myself for xgl wgl and agl. But before So here comes the Question: Which libraries / frameworks should i check out first before inventing the wheel again? Edit: So far named libraries: glut Qt SDL gtkglext wxwdigets SFML Hmm could be I would be curious if it were that simple. In my case it's just a Win32 reference build for a console game so I hadn't looked into it too deeply. Plus for debugging purposes I actually like/need to see the printfs. I'm using GLUT and wxWidgets successfully in two separate projects. The only downside to GLUT under Win32 is that it opens up a DOS window - good for seeing any printf's but it doesn't look as professional to have an app that opens up that window. @Jim: That's a bit in the executable that can easily be changed with `editbin` and is usually an artefact of compilation flags? wxWidgets is another alternative but may also be too heavyweight.  SMFL is another similar to SDL but takes a more object oriented approach. This one sounds promising ( their site says: SFML is composed of several packages to perfectly suit your needs. You can use SFML as a minimal windowing system to interface with OpenGL or as a fully-featured multimedia library for building games or interactive programs. ). I'm going to implement it myself - but since i think i can reuse some of the SMFL code i will accept this answer SFML is lovely. It doesn't (or maybe didn't) support creating contexts with stencil buffers but hey you can edit the code.  You could look at Glut (C) Qt (C++) SDL (C). I have already worked with glut (it was nice for the little opengl examples back at university but i think it wont fit in a bigger project). The Qt api seems nice - but i don't like the thought to introduce a dependecy to Qt. It seems to heavyweight for my needs. The same goes for SDL. There is also http://GtkGLExt.sf.net @Christoph: I can fully understand what you mean. In an inhouse solution for a former employer I had to solve a similar problem. First attempts were using the platform bindings I mentioned above. After a year or so I switched to your idea of implementing platform specifics myself.  libapril is nice also. It is clean simple and supports newer mobile platforms.,c++ opengl window multiplatform,0.307478252085605,0.691613520009371,4.7850694526513945E-4,4.2972095975877145E-4
1550130,"""Cloning"" row or column vectors Sometimes it is useful to ""clone"" a row or column vector to a matrix. By cloning I mean converting a row vector such as [123] Into a matrix [[123] [123] [123] ] or a column vector such as [1 2 3 ] into [[111] [222] [333] ] In matlab or octave this is done pretty easily:  x = [123] a = ones(31) * x a = 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 b = (x') * ones(13) b = 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 I want to repeat this in numpy but unsuccessfully In [14]: x = array([123]) In [14]: ones((31)) * x Out[14]: array([[ 1. 2. 3.] [ 1. 2. 3.] [ 1. 2. 3.]]) # so far so good In [16]: x.transpose() * ones((13)) Out[16]: array([[ 1. 2. 3.]]) # DAMN # I end up with In [17]: (ones((31)) * x).transpose() Out[17]: array([[ 1. 1. 1.] [ 2. 2. 2.] [ 3. 3. 3.]]) Why wasn't the first method (In[16]) working? Is there a way to achieve this task in python in a more elegant way? In Matlab note that it is much faster to use `repmat`: `repmat([1 2 3]31)` or `repmat([1 2 3].'13)` Octave also has `repmat`. First note that with numpy's broadcasting operations it's usually not necessary to duplicate rows and columns. See this and this for descriptions. But to do this repeat and newaxis are probably the best way In [12]: x = array([123]) In [13]: repeat(x[:newaxis] 3 1) Out[13]: array([[1 1 1] [2 2 2] [3 3 3]]) In [14]: repeat(x[newaxis:] 3 0) Out[14]: array([[1 2 3] [1 2 3] [1 2 3]]) This example is for a row vector but applying this to a column vector is hopefully obvious. repeat seems to spell this well but you can also do it via multiplication as in your example In [15]: x = array([[1 2 3]]) # note the double brackets In [16]: (ones((31))*x).transpose() Out[16]: array([[ 1. 1. 1.] [ 2. 2. 2.] [ 3. 3. 3.]]) @AFoglia - Good point. I updated my answer to point this out. newaxis has the additional benefit that it doesn't actually copy the data until it needs to. So if you are doing this to multiply or add to another 3x3 array the repeat is unnecessary. Read up on numpy broadcasting to get the idea.  Here's an elegant Pythonic way to do it: >>> array([[123]]*3) array([[1 2 3] [1 2 3] [1 2 3]]) >>> array([[123]]*3).transpose() array([[1 1 1] [2 2 2] [3 3 3]]) the problem with [16] seems to be that the transpose has no effect for an array. you're probably wanting a matrix instead: >>> x = array([123]) >>> x array([1 2 3]) >>> x.transpose() array([1 2 3]) >>> matrix([123]) matrix([[1 2 3]]) >>> matrix([123]).transpose() matrix([[1] [2] [3]]) (transpose works for 2D arrays e.g. for the square one in the example or when turning into a `(N1)`-shape array using `.reshape(-1 1)`)  I think using the broadcast in numpy is the best and faster I did a compare as following import numpy as np b = np.random.randn(1000) In [105]: %timeit c = np.tile(b[: newaxis] (1100)) 1000 loops best of 3: 354 ��s per loop In [106]: %timeit c = np.repeat(b[: newaxis] 100 axis=1) 1000 loops best of 3: 347 ��s per loop In [107]: %timeit c = np.array([b]*100).transpose() 100 loops best of 3: 5.56 ms per loop about 15 times faster using broadcast  Use numpy.tile: >>> tile(array([123]) (3 1)) array([[1 2 3] [1 2 3] [1 2 3]]) or for repeating columns: >>> tile(array([[123]]).transpose() (1 3)) array([[1 1 1] [2 2 2] [3 3 3]]) Upvote! On my system for a vector with 10000 elements repeated 1000 times the `tile` method is 19.5 times faster than the method in the currently accepted answer (using the multiplication-operator-method).",python matlab numpy octave linear-algebra,3.2511332910695455E-4,5.301992672494787E-4,4.53199074314062E-4,0.9986914883293294
640095,"When using a GL_RGBA16F_ARB-texture it contains just crap but I get no error message I generate a texture like this: GLuint id; glGenTextures(1 &id); glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D id); glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE); glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE); glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER GL_NEAREST); glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER GL_NEAREST); glTexImage2D( GL_TEXTURE_2D 0 GL_RGBA16 //GL_RGBA16F_ARB //< Won't work 256 256 0 GL_RGBA GL_FLOAT NULL ); glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D 0); I attach it to a framebuffer object (FBO) for rendering to. All of this works like a charm when I set the internal format to GL_RGBA16. However I need a higher dynamic range and was thinking that GL_RGBA16F_ARB might do the trick. Unfortunately if I replace GL_RGBA16 with GL_RGBA16F_ARB in the code given above the texture seems to stop working. Nothing I try to render to the FBO/texture sticks and when I use the texture it contains random garbage. (A lot of purple as it turns out) This would not be so frustrating if I had gotten an error message hinting at what might be wrong but I can't seem to find one. In other words glGetError() returns 0 after the glTexImage2D-call and glCheckFramebufferStatusEXT(GL_FRAMEBUFFER_EXT) returns GL_FRAMEBUFFER_COMPLETE_EXT when I have attached the texture I haven't messed with glClampColorARB(...) ... yet :) Have I forgotten to check for errors in a place/way that I haven't thought of? Do GL_RGBA16F_ARB-textures require any special treatment that I haven't given? Is there anything else that might be wrong? I'm stumped since everything works smoothly with GL_RGBA16... :( EDIT: When using GL_RGBA16F_ARB the first frame I try to render to screen doesn't make it. Seems to me that I should be getting an error message somewhere..? EDIT: By inspecting ShadowIce's working code example I figured out that the problems disappeared if I changed the depth buffer on my FBO and give glRenderBufferStorageEXT(...) GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT24 as its second parameter rather than GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT16. I have no idea why this works but apparently it does work. Also ShadowIce's code breaks like mine if I do the opposite substitution there. How are you actually filling the texture? I am attaching it to an FBO and rendering to it. There shouldn't be anything special to do for setting up a framebuffer with float textures. Some things I would check: Is the FBO bound and the draw/read buffer set correctly before you call glCheckFramebufferStatusEXT? Also try testing it right before you draw to it. Does the texture look ok after a simple glClear with a specific clear color? If yes there might be something wrong with your shaders (if you use any) or the way you draw to the FBO. Are your drivers up to date? And does the problem still exist on a PC with different hardware? How about GL_RGBA32F_ARB? Edit: Check the id of your framebuffer and texture also check if the texture id matches the one attached to your fbo (with glGetFramebufferAttachmentParameteriv). Normally I would guess that everything is ok with that if it works with a RGBA texture but random data (especially purple) is a good sign that nothing was written to the texture or it wasn't cleared properly. I have written a small example application that should work maybe that helps. I have only tested it on windows so for linux you might need to change it a bit: link The example you made worked nicely. Now to isolate the differences... I ought to create sockpuppet-accounts so I could thank you properly ;) Hehe thanks. ;) 1. Yes. Verified by testing right before drawing 2. No it does not look OK 3. I get my drivers from the Ubuntu-repository. Should be reasonably up to date (nvidia). I get the same problem om a different machine 4. I get the same result sometimes but now it has apparently locked completely! (4. continued:) When breaking it in a debugger the stack I get to see is only one deep with ""libGL"" as the only element. The program is completely locked and uses 100% CPU :O Also: Thanks! If you have any more ideas I'm all ears :)  GL_HALF_FLOAT_ARB might work as the type instead of GL_FLOAT. Thanks.

1095378,"How do I destruct data associated with an object after the object no longer exists? I'm creating a class (say C) that associates data (say D) with an object (say O). When O is destructed O will notify C that it soon will no longer exist :( ... Later when C feels it is the right time C will let go of what belonged to O namely D. If D can be any type of object what's the best way for C to be able to execute ""delete D;""? And what if D is an array of objects? My solution is to have D derive from a base class that C has knowledge of. When the time comes C calls delete on a pointer to the base class. I've also considered storing void pointers and calling delete but I found out that's undefined behavior and doesn't call D's destructor. I considered that templates could be a novel solution but I couldn't work that idea out. Here's what I have so far for C minus some details:  // This class is C in the above description. There may be many instances of C. class Context { public: // D will inherit from this class class Data { public: virtual ~Data() {} }; Context(); ~Context(); // Associates an owner (O) with its data (D) void add(const void* owner Data* data); // O calls this when he knows its the end (O's destructor). // All instances of C are now aware that O is gone and its time to get rid // of all associated instances of D. static void purge (const void* owner); // This is called periodically in the application. It checks whether // O has called purge and calls ""delete D;"" void refresh(); // Side note: sometimes O needs access to D Data *get (const void *owner); private: // Used for mapping owners (O) to data (D) std::map _data; }; // Here's an example of O class Mesh { public: ~Mesh() { Context::purge(this); } void init(Context& c) const { Data* data = new Data; // GL initialization here c.add(this new Data); } void render(Context& c) const { Data* data = c.get(this); } private: // And here's an example of D struct Data : public Context::Data { ~Data() { glDeleteBuffers(1 &vbo); glDeleteTextures(1 &texture); } GLint vbo; GLint texture; }; }; P.S. If you're familiar with computer graphics and VR I'm creating a class that separates an object's per-context data (e.g. OpenGL VBO IDs) from its per-application data (e.g. an array of vertices) and frees the per-context data at the appropriate time (when the matching rendering context is current). So if I understand correctly you want reference counting? Thanks all. In my program there is an update thread and a render thread. The render thread is responsible for rendering twice once for each eye to create a stereo image. Each 3D object O has eye-specific rendering data D for each context (i.e. for each O there are two copies of D). The problem: O can be created or destroyed in the update thread but O's eye-specific rendering data must be destroyed in the render thread and only when rendering the associated eye. C needs to know if O is destructed so that in the render thread it will know to destroy both instances of D. The question is rather vague on the requirements so it's hard to give a good concrete answer. I hope the following helps. If you want the data to disappear immediately when its owner dies have the owner delete it (and notify C if the C instances need to know). If you want C to do the deletion at its leisure your solution looks fine. Deriving from Data seems to me the right thing to do. (Of course it is crucial that ~Data() be virtual as you have done.) What if D is an array of objects? There are two interpretations of this question. If you mean that D is always an array let it be an array (or vector<>) of pointers to Data. Then in C::purge() walk the vector and delete the objects. If you mean that D could be an array of objects but could also be a single object there are two ways to go. Either decide that it is always an array (possibly of size 1) or that it is a single object (derived from Data) which can be a class wrapping the array of the actual objects (or pointers to them). In the latter case the wrapper class destructor should walk the array and do the deletions. Note that if you want the array (or vector<>) to contains the actual objects not pointers to them (in which case you won't have to walk the array and delete manually) then you'll have the following limitations. 1. All objects in the array will have to be of the same actual type. 2. You will have to declare the array to be of that type. This will lose you all the benfits of polymorphism.  To answer the question ""What if D is an array of objects ?"" I'd suggest a vector<> but you'd have to associate it with D:  struct D_vector :D { vector<whatever> vw; };  What you're looking for is Boost::shared_ptr or some similar smart-pointer system.",c++ opengl graphics,0.535990074668665,0.23447580408784485,0.08877871764967288,0.14075540359381722
618829,openGL glDrawElements with interleaved buffers Thus far i have only used glDrawArrays and would like to move over to using an index buffer and indexed triangles. I am drawing a somewhat complicated object with texture coords normals and vertex coords. All this data is gathered into a single interleaved vertex buffer and drawn using calls similar to ( Assuming all the serup is done correctly ): glVertexPointer( 3 GL_FLOAT 22 (char*)m_vertexData ); glNormalPointer( GL_SHORT 22 (char*)m_vertexData+(12) ); glTexCoordPointer( 2 GL_SHORT 22 (char*)m_vertexData+(18) ); glDrawElements(GL_TRIANGLES m_numTriangles GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT m_indexData ); Does this allow for m_indexData to also be interleaved with the indices of my normals and texture coords as well as the standard position index array? Or does it assume a single linear list of inidices that apply to the entire vertex format ( POS NOR TEX )? If the latter is true how is it possible to render the same vertex with different texture coords or normals? I guess this question could also be rephrased into: if i had 3 seperate indexed lists ( POS NOR TEX ) where the latter 2 cannot be rearranged to share the same index list as the first what is the best way to render that. You cannot have different indexes for the different lists. When you specify glArrayElement(3) then OpenGL is going to take the 3rd element of every list. What you can do is play with the pointer you specify since essentially the place in the list which is eventually accessed is the pointer offset from the start of the list plus the index you specify. This is useful if you have a constant offset between the lists. if the lists are just a random permutation then this kind of play for every vertex is probably going to be as costy as just using plain old glVertex3fv() glNormal3fv() and glTexCoord3fv() Just to confirm the indices used in glDrawElements apply to your entire vertex format every time a vertex occurs on that mesh it must have the same normal and texture coords? i ask because certain 3D apps export models where a given vertex position might have different normal & texture coords If you want the same vertex to appear in a mesh with two different sets normals and texture coords then you'll need to add the vertex twice to arrays. As far as OpenGL is concerned they are two different vertices.  I am having similar trouble attempting to do the same in Direct3D 9.0 For my OpenGL 3 implementation it was rather easy and my source code is available online if it might help you any... https://github.com/RobertBColton/enigma-dev/blob/master/ENIGMAsystem/SHELL/Graphics_Systems/OpenGL3/GL3model.cpp,c++ opengl vertex-buffer,0.8449644732849815,5.598070387441905E-4,4.7850694526513956E-4,0.1539972127310092

Thanks looking forward to your opinions :D You should only serialize data in the DB if the data is never needed to be processed by the DB. For example you could serialize user ID in the user_id field if you never need to do a query with the user_id field; e.g. never selecting anything based on user. If these are posts (blog/news/etc. posts?) then I'm pretty confident you'll need to be able to query them by user. Normalizing the user into another table would serve you: CREATE TABLE posts (post_id ....); CREATE TABLE post_users (post_id user_id ...); You can then get the users in a different query or use group_concat: SELECT post_id GROUP_CONCAT(user_id) FROM posts JOIN post_users USING (post_id) GROUP BY post_id. When you need to show user name just join to the users table to get their name in the group concat.  From RDBMS point of view i would 'have a new row for every new entry' Thats called m:n relationship table. You can then query the data however you like. If you need postid 12 | showto "":6:{i:0;i:2;i:1;i:3;i:2;i:3;i:3;i:4;i:4;i:5;i:5;i:6;}"". you can do SELECT postid CONCAT(':'count(showto)':{i:'GROUP_CONCAT(showto SEPARATOR ';i:')';}') AS showto FROM tablename GROUP BY postid However if you only need the data in 1 form and not do any other kind of queries on that data then you may aswell store the string. Wow never thought of this syntax :D ""CONCAT(':'count(showto)':{i:'GROUP_CONCAT(showto SEPARATOR ';i:')';}')"" might help me alot :D Thanks. +1 for givin me a cool idea :P  Most of the time the recommendation is that many-to-many relationships (such as posts to users) should have a mapping table with 1 row for each post-user combination (in other words your ""new row for every new entry"" version). It's more optimal for things like join queries and lets you retrieve only the data you need.  In cases when some one needs to store more than one value in a in a cell what approach is more desirable and advisable storing it with delimiters or glue and exploding it into an array later for processing in the server side language of choice for example. Neither. Oh goodness neither! Edgar F. Codd is rolling in his grave right now. Storing delimited data in a text field is no better than storing it in a flat file. The data becomes unqueryable. Storing PHP serialized data in a text field is even worse because then only PHP can parse the data. You want a nice happy normalized database. The thing you're trying to describe is a many-to-many relationship. Each user can maintain one or more posts. Likewise each post can be maintained by one or more user. Right? Then something like this will work. CREATE TABLE users ( user_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY ... ); CREATE TABLE posts ( post_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY ... ); CREATE TABLE user_posts ( user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(user_id) post_id INTEGER REFERENCES posts(post_id) UNIQUE KEY(user_id post_id) ); -- All posts made by user 22. SELECT posts.* FROM posts user_posts WHERE user_posts.user_id = 22 AND posts.post_id = user_posts.post_id -- All users that worked on post 47 SELECT users.* FROM users user_posts WHERE user_posts.post_id = 47 AND users.user_id = user_posts.user_id CREATE TABLE user_posts ( user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(user_id) post_id INTEGER REFERENCES posts(post_id) UNIQUE KEY(user_id post_id) ); This part can you clearify this a bit more for me please the INTEGER REFERENCES and UNIQUE KEY is this like a forign key constraint or something?. or its some sort of table that relates the post id with the userid And well i guess im convinced that I should not be storing data as delimited stings and serializations @Akay The `REFERENCES` clauses create foreign keys yes. This makes sure that you can't insert nonsensical identifiers in the link table. `UNIQUE KEY(col1 col2)` establishes something called a ""compound key"" -- two columns kind of glued together. In this case the combination of the two columns is unique. You couldn't insert `VALUES(1 2) (1 2)` for example. The restriction is in place because it makes sense for the data model I described above. It might not make sense if you need to store additional data in the link table about the nature of the relationship. You should not be using LEFT OUTER JOINs here. If user dont have a post it does not caontain in n:m table anyway and INNER JOIN allows much better optimisation. @Imre sorry bad habit from using a broken database engine that didn't understand the word ""INNER"". I'm editing to use worse/better syntax. @Charles Thanks alot im sure this will help me quite a bit to normalize my database :D its sad tho MySQL documentation is a bit tough to get around things need so much clarification :( . @Akay thankfully that's what SO is for.

Will this do what you want? correlations = dot(transpose(a) b)  As David said you should define the correlation you're using. I don't know of any definitions of correlation that gives sensible numbers when correlating empty and non-empty signals.",python numpy,3.55682466807502E-4,5.800518354410053E-4,4.958116148288485E-4,0.9985684540829226
1791791,"Stacking numpy recarrays without losing their recarrayness Suppose I make two recarrays with the same dtype and stack them: >>> import numpy as np >>> dt = [('foo' int) ('bar' float)] >>> a = np.empty(2 dtype=dt).view(np.recarray) >>> b = np.empty(3 dtype=dt).view(np.recarray) >>> c = np.hstack((ab)) Although a and b are recarrays c is not: >>> c.foo Traceback (most recent call last): File ""<stdin>"" line 1 in <module> AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'foo' >>> d = c.view(np.recarray) >>> d.foo array([ 0 111050731618561 0 7718048 8246760947200437872]) I can obviously turn it into a recarray again as shown with d above but that is inconvenient. Is there a reason why stacking two recarrays does not produce another recarray? Incidentally you can also use: c = np.concatenate((ab)) or c = np.r_[a b] ( Source: this mailing list message ) They don't preserve the recarrayness either.  Alternatively there are some helper utilities in numpy.lib.recfunctions which I stumbled across here. This module has functions for both merging and stacking recarrays: from numpy.lib.recfunctions import stack_arrays c = stack_arrays((a b) asrecarray=True usemask=False) c.foo >>> array([ 140239282560000 4376479720 -4611686018427387904 4358733828 4365061216]) If one wants to add extra columns to a recarray this can be done using merge_arrays: import numpy as np from numpy.lib.recfunctions import merge_arrays dt1 = [('foo' int) ('bar' float)] dt2 = [('foobar' int) ('barfoo' float)] aa = np.empty(6 dtype=dt1).view(np.recarray) bb = np.empty(6 dtype=dt2).view(np.recarray) cc = merge_arrays((aa bb) asrecarray=True flatten=True) type(cc) >>> numpy.core.records.recarray (Although not an answer to the question I'm posting the latter example as a reference)  I don't know. Most likely it's a bug/feature that's never been implemented. numpy.hstack is basically a wrapper around a function in numpy.core.fromnumeric. Numeric is one of the two predecessors of numpy. Most functions in numpy have a convention to output the same type as the input by calling the method __array_wrap__ of the input on the output and the resulting output is should have the same data but ""wrapped"" in the new class. Perhaps the concept of ""wrapping"" was not in numeric andnever got added to this function. You can use this technique to make a smarter stacking function def hstack2(arrays) : return arrays[0].__array_wrap__(numpy.hstack(arrays)) This works for both recarrays and regular arrays >>> f = hstack2((ab)) >>> type(f) <class 'numpy.core.records.recarray'> >>> f.foo array([ 140633760262784 111050731618561 140633760262800 7536928 8391166428122670177]) >>> x = numpy.random.rand(3) >>> y = numpy.random.rand(2) >>> z = hstack2((xy)) >>> type(z) <type 'numpy.ndarray'> I'm not sure what you're planning but you might want to ask on the numpy mailing list is there's a better way than using the documented but double-underscored method and what their reasoning is for not doing the wrapping themselves.",python numpy recarray,2.957814693617686E-4,0.012511753246742028,4.123112653738907E-4,0.9867801540185223
357562,"Java based Swing Browser should support JavaScript In my company I am implementing a java based html browser. I found a lot of tools to generate complete browsers only in Swing which are looking like Mozilla. But I was not able to find a browser which supports JavaScript. The browser I will implement should execute JavaScript inside the HTML sides. Do you know of a tool that supports this? Or do you know of a parser which pairs the javascript to something I can use inside the html browser? I know that the eclipse plugins can handle javascript but I can not use AWT in my project. Thanks for your help. I'd look at Lobo. It sounds like just want you want. It has a HTML Renderer and parser and some support for Javascript. If it's missing a feature of Javascript that you need it seems like it would easier to contribute to Lobo instead of reinventing the wheel. That sounds like a good solution. I will test this. Thanks Will you please tell me that how to implement this?  It will be available. I hope pretty soon. Its name is JWebPane and it is based on WebKit afaik.

There is nothing wrong with this code. I tried it out and it worked just fine. I wasn't sure exactly what you were pickling however I used an array of dicts because that looked similar. Works for me in Python 2.4.5 2.5.2 and with the obvious changes in Python 3.0. Please post actual test data for which it fails. Also what version of pickle are you using? pickle or cPickle? idMap is a list of dictionaries where dictionary is int-> tuple object. idMap[1] is available at http://pastebin.com/f44a58355 I'm using pickle not cPickle. I'm using Python 2.6.4 on WindowsXP (r264:75708 Oct 26 2009 08:23:19) [MSC v.1500 32 bit (Intel)] In my response below I used your data with pickle (not cPickle) on both python2.51 (Cygwin) and python3.1 (Windows) using all protocols and it works so pickling will only work with top level module functions and classes and will not pickle class data so if some numpy class code/data are required to produce a representation of the numpy void type pickling isn't going to work as expected. It may be that the numpy package has implemented an internal __repr__ to print the void type as a tuple if this is the case then what you pickled certainly is not going to be what you printed. jottos - if you submit that comment as an answer I'll accept it and close the question. That must be what's happening internally. I'm just wrapping it in a tuple call and the pickling works as expected. Something with your system (filesystem?) ; I would try pickling in binary mode; use dump(idMap idmapfile protocol=2) Did not fix the problem - same result.  So using python31 I made just a small change to your example and it worked fine. Note that I added the ""b"" for binary in the file open's I tried this with all protocols and it worked for each idmapfile = open(""idmap"" mode=""wb"") pickle.dump(idMap idmapfile) idmapfile.close() idmapfile = open(""idmap"" ""rb"") unpickled = pickle.load(idmapfile) print ('they are equal' unpickled == idMap) src> ./pick.py they are equal True  I agree. I think there is a problem with serializing numpy.void example that doesn't work (Python 2.7.3 numpy 1.6.1): import pickle numpy as np my_array = np.array([('hello' 45.5 'world')] dtype=[('a' str 10) ('b' float) ('c' str10)]) my_void = my_array[0] print my_void print pickle.loads(pickle.dumps(my_void)) which will print: ('hello' 45.5 'world') ('\xc0\x00llo' 45.5 'world') The first looks like a tuple but it is actually a numpy.void So to avoid this you can't have numpy.void you should instead wrap your void with numpy.array() or call .tolist() on your numpy.void. Edit: There is a bug in numpy https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/3188  so pickling will only work with top level module functions and classes and will not pickle class data so if some numpy class code/data are required to produce a representation of the numpy void type pickling isn't going to work as expected. It may be that the numpy package has implemented an internal repr to print the void type as a tuple if this is the case then what you pickled certainly is not going to be what you printed. ��� jottos Dec 29 '09 at 18:42",python serialization numpy marshalling pickle,1.8331681702474603E-4,2.989555744392517E-4,2.5553862097879153E-4,0.9992621889875573
248353,"Java GUI LayoutManagers I'm busy with an asignment where i have to make a graphical interface for a simple program. But i'm strugling with the layout. This is the idea: What is the easiest way to accomplish such a layout? And what method do you use to make layouts in java. Just code it or use an IDE like netbeans? I build everything by hand. Like Christian I've had bad experiences with GUI builders; they always either refused to configure a couple of components quite right or they generated huge amounts of unnecessary code which made later maintenance impractical or both. I used to do build a lot of UIs using GridBagLayout but for years I've never seen an office-environment UI that couldn't be built with nested BorderLayouts GridLayouts and the occasional BoxLayout or FlowLayout. About 98% of the stuff I've seen is doable with nested BorderLayouts. In your case the layout organization will be as bmeck says. Speaking from memory using CENTER for the JTable (remember to put it in a JScrollPane!) and NORTH for everything else ensures that if you resize your JFrame the JTable will get all of the extra space and that should be exactly what you want. For the top labels and fields the nested GridLayouts should ensure that each ""column"" of labels and fields will take up equal horizontal space. (They'll get only enough vertical space to be completely visible and no more since the JTable is taking up everything else.) Everything else is just a matter of adding borders and setting the GridLayout padding reasonably.  I've used GUI layout generating tools for super rapid development (maybe get the first 2 or 3 iterations of an interface out of the way). I've ultimately found that using a simple fixed layout (no layout manager) with these tools is the best approach. Once we are starting to hone in on a design we switch to manual layout. Whenever I've tried to use GUI generators to create code for layout managers I've almost always been bitten eventually where the layout would just stop working and I spent more time debugging the impossible to read auto-generated code than if I'd done the layout by hand anyway. For what it's worth when we are doing the early phase of layouts we use the Jigloo plugin for Eclipse. It's very inexpensive and does a good job. I'm a big fan of MiGLayout. I've found that it is incredibly easy to use for simple layouts and is capable of doing extremely complicated layouts. All without the need to resort to nested panels etc... JGoodies Forms is also good but harder to use.  And what method do you use to make layouts in java. Just code it or use an IDE like netbeans? NetBeans for GUI developers is like a calculator for grade schoolers: you really shouldn't use it until you know how to do things without it but then it will save you a lot of time. (I'd love to answer your primary question but the firewall I'm behind is blocking the picture.)  Well considering how simple the layout is I would suggest you use a BorderLayout with NORTH set to the top section in a container and the JTable in the CENTER of the BorderLayout. For the Top it appears to be a simple BorderLayout again with NORTH as the Instruction: south as the black box (possibly in a container with a FlowLayout). The center of the top pane appears to be 2 Containers of GridLayouts with 2 rows and 2 columns so put thos in another container with a GirdLayout. So in pseudo: Container(BorderLayout) { @NORTH Container(BorderLayout) { @NORTH Label(Instruction); @CENTER Container(GridLayout(21)) { Container(GirdLayout(22)) { Label() TextField() Label() TextField() } Container(GirdLayout(22)) { Label() TextField() Label() TextField() } } @SOUTH Container(FlowLayout()) { JButton() //shaded thing? } } @CENTER { JTable } }  Use GroupLayout :) All the alignments are pretty easy to do  For myself gui-builders for swing or swt never worked that well that's why i code layouts myself using layout managers. Your question doesn't mention which gui-system you are using but i assume you want to use swing. If that's the case I would recommend to use GridBagLayout for your layout. It is not that easy to use in the beginning but as soon as you know how it works you can do most layouts in the way you want it to be and i think it is also the layoutmanager of choice for the layout you want to do.  I used to love Motif's XmForm for this sort of thing. In Java I usually put Boxes inside of boxes. So I have a vertical box. First row of the box contains a JLabel for the Instruction. Second row contains something for the label/result stuff possibly some sort of grid. Third row contains whatever that blacked out thing Fourth row contains the JTable. Then I'd spend some time to try to figure out how to do the lable/result stuff. Then I'd probably end up saying ""dammit"" and doing it as a GridBagLayout.  I wrote an article a while back on layout managers: http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/onlineTraining/GUI/AWTLayoutMgr It describes how nesting (as bmeck above demonstrates) can be used very effectively for many UI designs.  Try table layout. Works great. https://tablelayout.dev.java.net/",java swing gui,0.0036271117266235653,0.9406094197574142,0.05555064367568433,2.1282484027784228E-4
680125,Can I use a grayscale image with the OpenGL glTexImage2D function? I have a texture which has only 1 channel as it's a grayscale image. When I pass the pixels in to glTexImage2D it comes out red (obviously because channel 1 is red; RGB). glTexImage2D( GL_TEXTURE_2D 0 GL_RGBA dicomImage->GetColumns() dicomImage->GetRows() 0 GL_RGBA GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE pixelArrayPtr); Do I change GL_RGBA? If so what to? It appears that I should use GL_LUMINANCE instead of GL_RGBA for the 3rd argument. Edit (in reply to comments): When I set the 7th argument to GL_LUMINANCE (as well as the 3rd) the picture goes completely distorted. With the DICOM pixel format it appears that the 7th argument must be GL_RGBA for some reason. The strange behavior is because I'm using the DICOM standard. The particular DICOM reader I am using outputs integer pixel values (as pixel values may exceed the normal maximum of 255). For some strange reason the combination of telling OpenGL that I am using an RGBA format but passing in integer values rendered a perfect image. Because I was truncating the DICOM > 255 pixel values anyway it seemed logical to copy the values in to a GLbyte array. However after doing so a SIGSEGV (segmentation fault) occurred when calling glTexImage2D. Changing the 7th parameter to GL_LUMINANCE (as is normally required) returned the functionality to normal. Weird eh? So a note to all developers using the DICOM image format: You need to convert the integer array to a char array before passing it to glTexImage2D or just set the 7th argument to GL_RGBA (the later is probably not recommended). My case is unusual see my edit for explanation. It is argument #7 that counts here! Hmm when change #7 it goes red... but #3 has the desired effect. Can you explain this please? As ypnos says arguments 7 and 8 are what you're interested in. They tell OpenGL the format of the data which the pointer points to. The earlier arguments indicate the type of texture as I recall. Nick argument #3 is for internal storage #7 is for input format. GL will convert from #7 to #3. The effect you are getting can have several reasons I can't tell from here. In almost every case however you want both be the same anyway.  Change it to GL_LUMINANCE. See http://www.opengl.org/documentation/specs/man_pages/hardcopy/GL/html/gl/teximage2d.html It seems your link is broken. (It redirects to the home page). [glTextImage2D](http://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man/xhtml/glTexImage2D.xml) works but it doesn't mention GL_LUMINANCE anywhere. It seems they obsoleted it... Deprecated in OpenGL 4.0. But OpenGL 4.0 does not have a fixed function pipeline you need to bind your own shaders that's why there is no use in LUMINANCE ALPHA etc. any more. You need to use GL_RED and process the single channel accordingly.,c++ opengl textures,0.7572071340941792,5.23280292383015E-4,0.0069721665149100505,0.23529741909852783
1632673,"Python File Slurp w/ endian conversion It was recently asked how to do a file slurp in python and the accepted answer suggested something like: with open('x.txt') as x: f = x.read() How would I go about doing this to read the file in and convert the endian representation of the data? For example I have a 1GB binary file that's just a bunch of single precision floats packed as a big endian and I want to convert it to little endian and dump into a numpy array. Below is the function I wrote to accomplish this and some real code that calls it. I use struct.unpack do the endian conversion and tried to speed everything up by using mmap.

Running the original code I had takes about 80 seconds or so. Running the solution provided by Alex Martelli and J F Sebastian is less than a second.

Thank you both for the help and for teaching me something =) with open(fileName ""rb"") as f: arrayName = numpy.fromfile(f numpy.float32) arrayName.byteswap(True) Pretty hard to beat for speed AND conciseness;-). For byteswap see here (the True argument means ""do it in place""); for fromfile see here. This works as is on little-endian machines (since the data are big-endian the byteswap is needed). You can test if that is the case to do the byteswap conditionally change the last line from an unconditional call to byteswap into for example: if struct.pack('=f' 2.3) == struct.pack('<f' 2.3): arrayName.byteswap(True) i.e. a call to byteswap conditional on a test of little-endianness. that is remarkably straightforward. thank you what's weird is i had seen those when trying to figure out how to do this but it just didn't register for some reason. comes with experience i suppose =) numpy.float32 has native byte order that might not be always big-endian. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1632673/python-file-slurp-w-endian-conversion/1633525#1633525 Indeed it will mostly be little-endian but if you're running e.g. on a Power PC machine it will be big endian (if that's an issue just conditionally omit the byteswap call -- let me edit the answer to add that bit). Testing sys.byteorder is a little more straightforward than using struct.pack.  Slightly modified @Alex Martelli's answer: arr = numpy.fromfile(filename numpy.dtype('>f4')) # no byteswap is needed regardless of endianess of the machine  I'd expect something like this to be faster arrayName[0] = unpack('>'+'f'*line_count*sample_count map.read(arrayName.itemsize*line_count*sample_count)) Please don't use map as a variable name  You could coble together an ASM based solution using CorePy. I wonder though if you might be able to gain enough performance from the some other part of your algorithm. I/O and manipulations on 1GB chunks of data are going to take a while which ever way you slice it. One other thing you might find helpful would be to switch to C once you have prototyped the algorithm in python. I did this for manipulations on a whole-world DEM (height) data set one time.

271888,"Best practice for handling null strings from database (in Java) In my database application I sometimes have to deal with null strings in the database. In most cases this is fine but when it comes do displaying data in a form the Swing components - using JTextField for example - cannot handle null strings. (.setText(null) fails) (EDIT: I just noticed that JTextField actually accepts a null string but the question remains for all other cases where unexpected null values can lead to problems.) The null values have no special meaning they can (must) be treated as empty strings. What is the best practice to deal with this problem? Unfortunatly I cannot change the database. Checking every value if it is null before calling setText()? Adding a try-catch handler to every setText() call? Introducing a static method which filters all null strings? Replace all null values to empty strings immediatly after reading from the database? ... [your suggestions] You could extend or wrap JTextField and overwrite the setText() method to replace NULL with an empty String. Yes but actually ""NULL"" can be legal value in DB ;> Indeed that is why you would wrap setText() & getText() so you can interchange null with """" for setText and vice versa for getText.  Use Beans Binding API to bind values from your entity objects to your SWING Widgets. Beanins Binding will transparently handle null values and will not replace the null with an empty string.  As Ruben said I would extend the JTextField to overwrite the setText() method and replace NULL with the empty string. However I would also overwrite the getText() method to overwrite empty string with NULL so that when you are saving back into the database you do not overwrite a null value in there with the empty string.  From a SQL angle try: select ISNULL(column_name'') from ... Someone just marked this answer down :(. While I accept that the question asks about Java. This solution can be used to handle ALL unexpected null values from a database. and as the question states ""unfortunately I can't change the database"" it implies that non java answers are also acceptable.  I think all your answers are reasonable but since you tagged this ""best practices"" I'd like to remind you of the null object design pattern. Wherever it seems worth the effort for whatever class need the protection write special instantiation code for a ""null"" object of that class. The idea is this ""null"" object is real and can behave appropriately no matter what you ask it to do. Your null ""String"" object could provide whatever you want as it's value. This pattern also means you can get rid of lots of null checks and the code is more robust. It does use up a bit of CPU sending messages to nulls and having them do nothing so it is less desirable when a large percentage of objects are expected to be null.  If you are using any ORM tool or somehow you map your DB fields to Java bean you can allways have:  public void setFoo(String str) { this.foo = str != null ? str : """"; } On Oracle i don't believe this is an issue. It may depend on settings but our 10g implementation interprets empty strings as nulls. Other DBMS's and perhaps other configurations may vary. You do have to be careful when writing back the data to the DB since you will be inserting an empty String instead of the NULL value! I think that's the best solution but I will change the getter. (I guess that's what you meant all along) I think Marko ment the setter since that is used by most ORM tools e.g. hibernate to put the values from the database into the instances. When using the getter you still need to be carefull for side effects in the database when using an ORM tool. FWIW I'd flip the inequality to an equality test. Just another best practice (or opinion depending on how you look at it). public void setFoo(String str) { this.foo = str == null ? """" : str; } Then how would you check whether the value is empty in the DB or NULL from your Entity object?  If you can add a default value - empty string - for a field in DB .

You might want to take a look at http://mysqldump.azundris.com/archives/36-Serving-Images-From-A-Database.html and http://hashmysql.org/index.php?title=Storing_files_in_the_database before doing that. Storing files in mysql is generally considered a bad idea.  Just use different CSS rules for each user. Create the CSS dynamically though PHP based on user-specific variables. For example if they have a div with an avatar or some other personal image just create a class that uses variables for images and then you really only need one or two files at most to do the whole thing. I would use a heredoc but you could just use quotation marks to integrate the PHP. php creates your css - .useravatar{ 'background: url($baseurl.$urseridpic)'} In the html the div just needs the class of 'useravatar' never needing to be changed.  Your page would be faster if you generate a directory on your filespace for each user and store their css/js/image files there. The reason for this is that when you like to output your images to the browser you will need to establish an own db connection for each file (since each is an own HTTP request to a PHP file selecting the image).

1533380,c++ opengl converting model coordinates to world coordinates for collision detection (This is all in ortho mode origin is in the top left corner x is positive to the right y is positive down the y axis) I have a rectangle in world space which can have a rotation m_rotation (in degrees). I can work with the rectangle fine it rotates scales everything you could want it to do. The part that I am getting really confused on is calculating the rectangles world coordinates from its local coordinates. I've been trying to use the formula: x' = x*cos(t) - y*sin(t) y' = x*sin(t) + y*cos(t) where (x y) are the original points (x' y') are the rotated coordinates and t is the angle measured in radians from the x-axis. The rotation is counter-clockwise as written. -credits duffymo I tried implementing the formula like this: //GLfloat Ax = getLocalVertices()[BOTTOM_LEFT].x * cosf(DEG_TO_RAD( m_orientation )) - getLocalVertices()[BOTTOM_LEFT].y * sinf(DEG_TO_RAD( m_orientation )); //GLfloat Ay = getLocalVertices()[BOTTOM_LEFT].x * sinf(DEG_TO_RAD( m_orientation )) + getLocalVertices()[BOTTOM_LEFT].y * cosf(DEG_TO_RAD( m_orientation )); //Vector3D BL = Vector3D(AxAy0); I create a vector to the translated point store it in the rectangles world_vertice member variable. That's fine. However in my main draw loop I draw a line from (000) to the vector BL and it seems as if the line is going in a circle from the point on the rectangle (the rectangles bottom left corner) around the origin of the world coordinates. Basically as m_orientation gets bigger it draws a huge circle around the (000) world coordinate system origin. edit: when m_orientation = 360 it gets set back to 0. I feel like I am doing this part wrong: and t is the angle measured in radians from the x-axis. Possibly I am not supposed to use m_orientation (the rectangles rotation angle) in this formula? Thanks! edit: the reason I am doing this is for collision detection. I need to know where the coordinates of the rectangles (soon to be rigid bodies) lie in the world coordinate place for collision detection. what you do is rotation [ special linear transformation] of a vector with angle Q on 2d.It keeps vector length and change its direction around the origin. [linear transformation : additive L(m + n) = L(m) + L(n) where {m n} �� vector  homogeneous L(k.m) = k.L(m) where m �� vector and k �� scalar ] So: You divide your vector into two pieces. Like m[1 0] + n[0 1] = your vector. Then as you see in the image rotation is made on these two pieces after that your vector take the form: m[cosQ sinQ] + n[-sinQ cosQ] = [m*cosQ - n*sinQ m*sinQ + n*cosQ] you can also look at Wiki Rotation If you try to obtain eye coordinates corresponding to your object coordinates you should multiply your object coordinates by model-view matrix in opengl. For M => model view matrix and transpose of [x y z w] is your object coordinates you do: M[x y z w]T = Eye Coordinate of [x y z w]T Thank you. I will work on this later tonight! :) OpenGL handles graphics not linear algebra operations. If he needs the transformed coordinates for collision detection that's a bad advice in my opinion. But +1 for a good explanation. If you use OpenGL to transform the mesh during the actual rendering remember to rotate about the Z axis.  This seems to be overcomplicating things somewhat: typically you would store an object's world position and orientation separately from its set of own local coordinates. Rotating the object is done in model space and therefore the position is unchanged. The world position of each coordinate is the same whether you do a rotation or not - add the world position to the local position to translate the local coordinates to world space. Any rotation occurs around a specific origin and the typical sin/cos formula presumes (00) is your origin. If the coordinate system in use doesn't currently have (00) as the origin you must translate it to one that does perform the rotation then transform back. Usually model space is defined so that (00) is the origin for the model making this step trivial.,c++ opengl matrix rotation trigonometry,0.987988041228291,3.0007417112017066E-4,2.564947652280153E-4,0.011455389835360933

Overriding JTree#getToolTipText(MouseEvent e) is only called when needed and as such is a much better solution! See getTooltipText on JTree. This should allow you to show tooltips depending on what in the tree is being hovered over. (Do read the docs though you need to register the JTree with the ToolTipManager.)  Yeah you can use onMouseMoved and then use a method (I don't remember the name) that tells you in which node you are over. If you get null obviously then you are not over a node. Since it's not mentioned elsewhere: the methods linking mouse position to tree node are `getPathForLocation(int int)` and `getRowForLocation(int int)`. As suggested by other answers implementing custom renderer or overriding `getToolTipText(MouseEvent)` is cleaner than adding a `MouseListener`.",java swing tooltip jtree,4.41998042349977E-4,0.8905325816998835,0.10847210470705361,5.533155507129839E-4
573487,"Any way to create a NumPy matrix with C API? I read the documentation on NumPy C API I could find but still wasn't able to find out whether there is a possibility to construct a matrix object with C API ��� not a two-dimensional array. The function is intended for work with math matrices and I don't want strange results if the user calls matrix multiplication forgetting to convert this value from an array to a matrix (multiplication and exponentiation being the only difference that matrix subclass has). What do you mean by ""matrix""? Is it `numpy.matrix` class? You can call any python callable with the PyObject_Call* functions. PyObject *numpy = PyImport_ImportModule(""numpy""); PyObject *numpy_matrix = PyObject_GetAttrString(numpy ""matrix""); PyObject *my_matrix = PyObject_CallFunction(numpy_matrix ""(s)"" ""0 0; 0 0""); This will create a matrix my_matrix of size 2x2. EDIT: Changed references to numpy.zeros/numpy.ndarray to numpy.matrix instead. I also found a good tutorial on the subject: http://starship.python.net/crew/hinsen/NumPyExtensions.html OP asks `numpy.matrix` but `zeros` returns `ndarray`.  numpy.matrix is an ordinary class defined in numpy/core/defmatrix.py.

For example if I wanted delete course_id=10 I would want any sessions with course_id=10 to be deleted in addition any bookings associated with any of these sessions need to be deleted too. Is this possible? what is the best way to approach it? (I'm writing this in PHP.) Any help much appreciated! does the sessions table reference itself with the session_id key? I think the best way would be to configure the tables adding proper foreign keys (you'll have to use InnoDB for this to actually work in mysql) and setting the behavior of the FKs to 'ON DELETE CASCADE'. This way when you delete something from the courses table the related bookings and sessions will be deleted automatically. Some linksies: MySQL DELETE with possible gotchas about this.

Also it's _id for the keys. @Adriano Varoli Piazza: `DELETE ON CASCADE` isn't a recommended practice because someone else wouldn't necessarily know it is in place & end up wiping out data they shouldn't have. While it seems like more work being explicit about what is being done is the best approach. Hi There Thanks for the response I am attempting to use the first multi delete method: DELETE FROM bookings sessions courses USING bookings JOIN sessions JOIN courses WHERE bookings.session_id=sessions.session_id AND sessions.course_id=courses.course_id AND courses.course_id=""13"" This doesn't seem to be working - is my syntax correct? -Thanks! If you don't use transactions *don't use a sequence of related actions*. @bart: Yes which is why I mentioned ""stored procedure"". @Fred: What error are you getting?

If it's the programmer he could study the db schema before twiddling random bits shouldn't he? Also backups are delicious. @Adriano Varoli Piazza: People don't all share the same skill sets and centralization of configuration is a principle every app strives for.

You could ask the question on SO. @Adriano Varoli Piazza: Any shop where there's more than one person able to make changes to the database. It's the same rationale why triggers aren't liked - there's now multiple places to check for configuration to know why something happened because something was done ""auto-magically"". I agree co-workers should be diligent but they aren't all as familiar with the technology as you are. @Fred perhaps you have to use the alternative syntax? DELETE bookings sessions courses FROM bookings INNER JOIN sessions ON bookings.session_id = session.session_id INNER JOIN courses ON sessions.course_id = courses.course_id WHERE courses.course_id = '10' @Fred: Missed your comment update answer. @OMG Ponies that argument sounds very shallow to me: ""We might hire crappy coders so we can't do things the proper (to me at least) way. Let's enforce the way through code"". This is not 'hiding' or 'automagic'. This is stated clearly in the DB schema which one should learn before coding their way into a paperbag.

2798572,Will MySql caching cause performance problems? I am about to upload my website onto a VPS. It is a classifieds website where all data is stored in MySql and Solr. I wonder if when using MySql:s cache the server will slow down? Ie if somebody makes a search for the first time and MySql is to cache the query will the caching make the server slower than if it would not cache anything? After the caching is done I know things will improve in terms of performance... But I would like to know if I should even use the cache or not what do you think? Thanks Best is not to make any assumptions but to do some benchmarking. There are several programs available to benchmark a website. I've never run into a situation where Mysql caching was detrimental to performance. The first time a query is run there is no performance hit when the query is written to Mysql's memory cache. The only significant resource used when query caching is memory. The more memory you configure Mysql to use the more it will cache. But to get the real answer you need to test it. Gathering metrics is the only way to get a real answer for your particular situation.

My cube isn't rendering as expected when I use GL_BLEND. glEnable(GL_CULL_FACE); glEnable(GL_BLEND); glBlendFunc(GL_SRC_ALPHA GL_ONE); I'm also having a similar problem with drawing some semi-opaque vertices in front which could well be related. Related: Why do my semi-opaque vertices make background objects brighter in OpenGL? Here's what it's supposed to look like: And here's what it actually looks like: Please see the code used to create the colored cube and the code used to actually draw the cube. The cube is being drawn like so: glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT); glPushMatrix(); glLoadIdentity(); // ... do some translation rotation etc ... drawCube(); glPopMatrix(); // ... swap the buffers ... Did you get the first picture from your program? It looks like you have lighting enabled on the second one try with a glShadeModel( GL_FLAT ) before drawing Hmm no this makes the sides of the cube solid colours but only 3 of them...  You could try disabling all lighting before drawing the cube: glDisable(GL_LIGHTING);  This has me stomped. What it looks like is that some vertices have some alpha values that are non-opaque. However the code you posted has all 1. for alpha. So... in order to debug more did you try to change your clear color to something non-black ? Say green ? From the code I doubt lighting is turned on since no normals were specified. Last comment offtopic... You should really not use glBegin/glEnd (2 function calls per vertex + 2 per primitive is really not a good usage of the recent developments in OpenGL). Try glDrawElements with QUAD_LIST or even better TRIANGLE_LIST.

1080635,"Other's library #define naming conflict Hard to come up with a proper title for this problem. Anyway... I'm currently working on a GUI for my games in SDL. I've finished the software drawing and was on my way to start on the OpenGL part of it when a weird error came up. I included the ""SDL/SDL_opengl.h"" header and compile. It throws ""error C2039: 'DrawTextW' : is not a member of 'GameLib::FontHandler'"" which is a simple enough error but I don't have anything called DrawTextW only FontHandler::DrawText. I search for DrawTextW and find it in a #define call in the header ""WinUser.h""! //WinUser.h #define DrawText DrawTextW Apparently it replaces my DrawText with DrawTextW! How can I stop it from spilling over into my code like that? It's a minor thing changing my own function's name but naming conflicts like this seem pretty dangerous and I would really like to know how to avoid them all together. Cheers! Just #undef the symbols you don't want. But Make sure that you include windows.h and do this before you include SDL: #include <windows.h> #undef DrawText #include <SDL/SDL_opengl.h>  You have a couple of options all of which suck. Add #undef DrawText in your own code Don't include windows.h. If another library includes it for you don't include that directly. Instead include it in a separate .cpp file which can then expose your own wrapper functions in its header. Rename your own DrawText. When possible I usually go for the middle option. windows.h behaves badly in countless other ways (for example it doesn't actually compile unless you enable Microsoft's proprietary C++ extensions) so I simply avoid it like the plague. It doesn't get included in my files if I can help it. Instead I write a separate .cpp file to contain it and expose the functionality I need. Also feel free to submit it as a bug and/or feedback on connect.microsoft.com. Windows.h is a criminally badly designed header and if people draw Microsoft's attention to it there's a (slim) chance that they might one day fix it. The good news is that windows.h is the only header that behaves this badly. Other headers generally try to prefix their macros with some library-specific name to avoid name collisions they try to avoid creating macros for common names and they try avoid using more macros than necessary. Yeah Windows.h does collide. I guess it is fair to complain it doesn't compile w/o ms extensions enabled but it is also reasonable that an ms-specific header should (require those extensions).  It's an unfortunate side effect of #includeing <windows.h>. Assuming you're not actually using Windows' DrawText() anywhere in your program it's perfectly safe to #undef it immediately after: // wherever you #include <windows.h> or any other windows header #include <windows.h> #undef DrawText It could. But that would require Microsoft to care. Thanks! It compiles fine now. Quite an annoying side effect indeed. Seems as if the SDL_opengl.h includes the windows.h but the #undef does it's job. Could the windows.h have been written differently to avoid this problem?  There is no general way of avoiding this problem - once you #include a header file using the preprocessor it can redefine any name it likes and there is nothing you can do about it. You can #undef the name but that assumes you know the name was #defined in the first place.",c++ opengl sdl,0.8281568964636083,0.17116985191168071,3.547078619288683E-4,3.18543762781952E-4
476678,"Tabs with equal (constant) width in JTabbedPane I'm trying to get a JTabbedPane where all tabs (the actual tabs not the components) have the same width (either the minimum width needed for the widest label or a constant width). I've tried to override BasicTabbedPaneUI.getTabBounds(int tabIndex Rectangle dest) but apparently this method isn't used by the painting methods of BasicTabbedPaneUI instead it uses a rects array to determine the tabs size. My next approach would be to override JTabbedPane.insertTab(String title Icon icon Component component String tip int index) and setting the preferred size of the label component but this doesn't seem very elegant and I'm not even sure it would work at all. Is there a way to achieve this? The answer is simple. When we put the name for the tab just format the name using html. say tp - JTabbedPane object tp.addTab(""<html><body><table width='150'>Name</table></body></html>""Componentobject) This sounds very good. I've seen other situations where html was the only way to achieve something in swing (e.g. line wrap on tooltips). I'll definitely give it a try.  I think it's not as complicated as you've done. Just use setTabComponentAt() with a JLabel on which you've set preferred size. That works thanks. Unfortunately I have to set all other parameters of the label component (color font size etc.) myself. I thought of retrieving the label via getTabComponentAt() but it returns null all the time. Yep that's because the getter only gets a label that was previously set (I think the doco specifically mentions that).  I've tried the following: tabPane.setUI(new javax.swing.plaf.metal.MetalTabbedPaneUI() { @Override protected int calculateTabHeight(int tabPlacement int tabIndex int fontHeight) { return super.calculateTabHeight(tabPlacement tabIndex fontHeight) + 12; } }); This seems to work fine for me. But if your using a different L&F you'll end up rendering it with the 'metal' regardless. I guess you could get the default UI and do an 'instanceof' on it to determine which is being used and instantiate it accordingly. For example: TabbedPaneUI ui = tabPane.getUI(); if (ui instanceof WindowsTabbedPaneUI) { // Create the windows rendition } else if (ui instanceof MetalTabbedPaneUI) { // Create the metal rendition } else if (ui instanceof MotifTabbedPaneUI) { // Create the motif rendition } else if (ui instanceof SynthTabbedPaneUI) { // Etc... } Thanks but this is only affecting the tab height not the width right? @Ole: That's right I don't know how I came to read width and end up giving a height example. Ah well now there for others who may need it I guess.  this is worked for me.  JLabel lab = new JLabel(); lab.setPreferredSize(new Dimension(200 30)); jTabbedPane1.setTabComponentAt(0 lab); // tab index jLabel or try this change to all tab component in same sizes (called in main method) UIManager.getLookAndFeelDefaults().put(""TabbedPane:TabbedPaneTab.contentMargins"" new Insets(10 100 0 0));",java swing jtabbedpane,0.08821563344276043,0.9109673837441609,4.3043375793447026E-4,3.865490551441962E-4
2754770,Kohana v3 automatically escape illegal characters? Quick question does Kohana (version 3) automatically escape data that is passed into ORM::factory..... (and everywhere else that has to do with the database)? For example: $thread = ORM::factory('thread' $this->request->param('id')); Would the data passed in the second argument be auto-escaped before it goes in the SQL query or do I have to manually do it? Probably a stupid question and it's better to be safe than sorry but yeah... I usually do manually escape the data but I want to know if Kohana does this for me? Thanks It's auto-escaped. The only scenario where you have to worry about escaping is if you're writing your own SQL and inserting your data directly (by way of concatenation for example) which you shouldn't be doing. The normal ways of querying a database in Kohana are parametrized queries (if you need to provide the SQL yourself) the query builder and ORM all of which handle escaping for you. Can you show me where it says it escapes it? or did you look at the code? I wasn't able to find anything on the site when i looked. @Galen: Sorry for the late response ��� see the docs for the query builder (which is what ORM uses internally): http://docs.kohanaphp.com/libraries/database/builder#limitations,php sql database security kohana-3,7.652796175992753E-4,0.2502385027939109,0.7480382017773561,9.580158111335735E-4
3746632,"PHP: SELECT ing 2 tables? I have a activities page and a statusmessages page for each user. In activities it contains what the users have done such as being friends with someone commented on pictures and so. users_activities id | uID | msg | date In users_statusmessages I got the statusmessages the user creates. users_statuses id | uID | message | date uID is the user��s id. Now i would like to select both of them and while{} them in one. Where they get sorted by date desc ( as the date in both tables is UNIX timestamp). So something like WHERE uID = '$userID' ORDER BY date DESC So example of how i wish it to look: User: Today is a good day (message) (date: 1284915827) (users_statuses) User have added as Jack as friend (msg) (date: 1284915811) (users_activities) User: I have a hard day today (message) (date: 1284915801) (users_statuses) User have commented on Jacks picture (msg) (date: 1284915776) (users_activities) How should i do this the right way? Something like this would do SELECT act.*status.* FROM users_activities act users_statuses status WHERE act.id = status.id AND status.id = '$UID' ORDER BY status.dateact.date DESC LIMIT 30 Spaced out for visual purposes: SELECT act.*status.* FROM users_activities act users_statuses status WHERE act.id = status.id AND status.id = '$UID' ORDER BY status.dateact.date DESC LIMIT 30 You may have misread the question. There is no relationship between activities and statuses as far as I can tell.  You need to use the UNION operator:  SELECT ua.msg ua.date 'activity' AS is_table FROM USERS_ACTIVITIES ua WHERE ua.uid = '{$userID}' UNION ALL SELECT us.message us.date 'status' FROM USERS_STATUSES us WHERE us.uid = '{$userID}' ORDER BY `date` UNION UNION removes duplicates. UNION ALL does not remove duplicates and is faster for it. But the data types at each position in the SELECT must match. In the query provided you can see that the date column is referenced in the second position. You'd get an error if the column order were reversed between the first and second query. The ORDER BY is applied to the result of the UNION'd query in standard SQL. In MySQL that includes the LIMIT clause. But MySQL also supports putting brackets around the UNION'd queries so you can use ORDER BY & LIMIT before the queries are UNION'd. When im using this in a while($show = mysql_fetch_array($query)) im receiving: mysql_fetch_array() expects parameter 1 to be resource boolean given in. This is because ORDER BY ua.date  how can i solve this? @Karem: Typo on my part see the update. And while waiting for answer on the ORDER part i tried echo $show[""msg""] and it works well gets all the user��s status but when I do $show[""message""] show anything. just noticed when i do $show[""msg""] it shows BOTH msg and messages like I wanted @Karem: Yes the column reference is based on the first of the UNION'd queries. Sorry mentioned everything but that. Ok last thing i think im trying to sort out WHERE `uID` = '$USER' but then i dont get any results. How is this wrong? @Karem: Sorry I missed that requirement. See the updated one. @OMG Ponies; ty OK almost there just one last thing how can i know if its from the status or activity? Example i want to make $show[""status""] bold if its a status else if its a activity just display without having it bold. How can i check for that? Last question before accepting thank you @Karem: Add a column with statically defined values. See the update I labelled the column ""is_table"". You can check the value in PHP and handle presentation accordingly. So let me get this clear: I make a column called ""activity"" in users_activities and a column in users_statuses called ""status"" ? And then make a standardvalue ""1"" for it? And then after that i check by doing if(isset($show[""is_table""] == 1)) ? Sorry if im asking too much @Karem: Using what I provided `$show['is_table'] == 'activity'` for knowing when to handle activities; `$show['is_table'] == 'status'` for statuses. You can change the value to be numeric if you like. Yes ok so standardvalue should be status/activity ? OH my bad! I thought you want me to add an column in the table.. But now i understand what you did thank you accepted and +1! @Karem: I should have said ""derived column"" sorry.

934616,How do I find out if a numpy array contains integers? I know there is a simple solution to this but can't seem to find it at the moment. Given a numpy array I need to know if the array contains integers. Checking the dtype per-se is not enough as there are multiple int dtypes (int8 int16 int32 int64 ...). Please specify whether you want to check whether the **type** is an integer or whether the **value** is an integer (see [my solution](http://stackoverflow.com/a/7236784/866007)). Checking for an integer type does not work for floats that are integers e.g. 4. Better solution is np.equal(np.mod(x 1) 0) as in: >>> import numpy as np >>> def isinteger(x): ... return np.equal(np.mod(x 1) 0) ... >>> foo = np.array([0. 1.5 1.]) >>> bar = np.array([-5 1 2 3 -4 -2 0 1 0 0 -1 1]) >>> isinteger(foo) array([ True False True] dtype=bool) >>> isinteger(bar) array([ True True True True True True True True True True True True] dtype=bool) >>> isinteger(1.5) False >>> isinteger(1.) True >>> isinteger(1) True  Found it in the numpy book! Page 23: The other types in the hierarchy de��ne particular categories of types. These categories can be useful for testing whether or not the object returned by self.dtype.type is of a particular class (using issubclass). issubclass(n.dtype('int8').type n.integer) >>> True issubclass(n.dtype('int16').type n.integer) >>> True  This also works:  n.dtype('int8').kind == 'i' For unsigned dtype kind = 'u'.

3463844,"Optimize a rankings page using PHP and MySQL I could really use some help optimizing a table on my website that is used to display rankings. I have been reading a lot on how to optimize queries and how to properly use indexes but even after implementing changes I thought would work little improvement can be seen. My quick fix has been simply to use only the top 100000 rankings (updated daily and stored in a different table) to improve the speed for now but I really don't like that option. So I have a table that stores the information for users that looks something like: table 'cache': id (Primary key) name region country score There are other variables being stored about the user but I don't think they are relevant here as they are not used in the rankings. There are 3 basic ranking pages that a user can view: A world view: SELECT cache nameregioncountryscore FROM cache ORDER BY score DESC LIMIT 026 A region view: SELECT nameregioncountryscore FROM cache WHERE region='Europe' ORDER BY score DESC LIMIT 026 and a country view: SELECT nameregioncountryscore FROM cache WHERE region='Europe' AND country='Germany' ORDER BY score DESC LIMIT 026 I have tried almost every combination of indexes I can think of to help alleviate work for the database and while some seem to help a little bit I can't find one that will only return 26 rows for both the region and country queries(with simply an index on 'score' the world rankings are blazing fast). I feel like I might be missing something basic any help would be much appreciated! Little extra info: the cache table is currently around 920 megabytes with a little more than 800000 rows total. If you could use any more info just let me know. Nice try Ponies. We know you mean well. :-) I knew something looked off. Fixed. Your world rankings benefit from the score index because score is the only criteria in the query. The logical sequence it sorts on is built into the query. So that's good. The other queries will benefit from an index on region. However similar to what @Matt indicates a composite index on region country and score may be the best bet. Note the three columns for the key should be in region country score sequence. From what you provided it seems that that index would be best. Are there times when the query has a country filter but no region filter? If yes then an index on region will probably provide the best solution for that type of query. I don't agree with the statement ""Too many indices will slow you down."" You want to create the ""right"" indexe(s) and that may mean more than one. Thanks for the response but I've actually already tried using this index. It definately is 10x faster then doing a full table scan but doesn't show the speed I need when searching for countries in particular. If this is the best index to use maybe this problem has just come down to not having a powerful enough server to host this database?  How many records are we talking about? I am no SQL guru but in this case if just changes to indexes did not do the trick. I would consider playing around with the table structure to see what perf gains I could get. Cache id (pk) LocationId (index) name score Location LocationId (pk) CountryId (index) maybe RegionId (index) maybe Country CountryId name Region RegionId name Location LocationId (Primary key) CountryId RegionId Country CountryId name Region RegionId name Temp tables in Procs would allow you to select on Location Id in every case. It would reduce the over all complexity of the issue you are having: you would be troubleshooting 1 query plan not 3. The effort would be high and the payoff would be until you were done so I would suggest looking at the index approach first. Good luck We're talking about 850000+ records and growing by about 2500/day. I will keep this response in mind for a time when I have time to restructure the tables.  put ONE index on country score region.

568962,How do I create an empty array/matrix in NumPy? I'm sure I must be being very dumb but I can't figure out how to use an array or matrix in the way that I would normally use a list. I.e. I want to create an empty array (or matrix) and then add one column (or row) to it at a time. At the moment the only way I can find to do this is like: mat = None for col in columns: if mat is None: mat = col else: mat = hstack((mat col)) Whereas if it were a list I'd do something like this: list = [] for item in data: list.append(item) Is there a way to use that kind of notation for NumPy arrays or matrices? (Or a better way -- I'm still pretty new to python!) A NumPy array is a very different data structure from a list and is designed to be used in different ways. Your use of hstack is potentially very inefficient... every time you call it all the data in the existing array is copied into a new one. (The append function will have the same issue.) If you want to build up your matrix one column at a time you might be best off to keep it in a list until it is finished and only then convert it into an array. e.g.  mylist = [] for item in data: mylist.append(item) mat = numpy.array(mylist) item can be a list an array or any iterable as long as each item has the same number of elements. In this particular case (data is some iterable holding the matrix columns) you can simply use  mat = numpy.array(data) (Also note that using list as a variable name is probably not good practice since it masks the built-in type by that name which can lead to bugs.) EDIT: If for some reason you really do want to create an empty array you can just use numpy.array([]) but this is rarely useful! Are numpy arrays/matrices fundamentally different from Matlab ones? @levesque Look [HERE](http://www.scipy.org/NumPy_for_Matlab_Users)  ARRAY OBJECTS Array objects consist of one- or multidimensional homogeneous fixed-size structures i.e. they have a fixed number of elements all of the same datatype (which allows much faster methods than Python's list object). An array element is retrieved as A[ijk..] (list elements are retrieved as L[i][j][k]..). A matrix is a two-dimensional array. Arrays a have attributes a.attr which can be distinguished in properties and methods a.meth(). The former return values (such as the shape and type) that belong to the array; the latter specify actions that are to be performed on the array. Often there is a function that performs the same action as a method; function and method then have the same name. Howeverthe default settings of the parameters may differ for methods and their corresponding functions. Array construction Arrays can be created in various ways: with the function array(obj) where 'obj' is a (nested) sequence e.g. a list [ ] or a tuple ( ). When 'obj' is an array a copy of this array is returned. The function matrix does the same for matrices. with the function copy(obj) where 'obj' is another array or matrix or a (nested) sequence with the function asarray(obj) which is like 'copy' except that no copy is made if 'obj' is already an array. with the function empty(shape dtype) which produces an uninitialized array with specified shape and typecode or with the function empty_like(a) which produces an uninitialized array with the same shape and typecode as its argument a with the function ones(shape dtype) producing an array initialized with ones or ones_like(a). with the function zeros(shape dtype) producing an array initialized with zeros or zeros_like(a) with the function identity(ndtype) producing a 2-d n*n identity matrix with the function arange(..) which does the same as array(range(..)) with the function concatenate(..) which concatenates sequences to an array. When you copy-paste documentation in place of an answer you should cite a source.  You have the wrong mental model for using NumPy efficiently. NumPy arrays are stored in contiguous blocks of memory. If you want to add rows or columns to an existing array the entire array needs to be copied to a new block of memory creating gaps for the new elements to be stored. This is very inefficient if done repeatedly to build an array. In the case of adding rows your best bet is to create an array that is as big as your data set will eventually be and then add data to it row-by-row: >>> import numpy >>> a = numpy.zeros(shape=(52)) >>> a array([[ 0. 0.] [ 0. 0.] [ 0. 0.] [ 0. 0.] [ 0. 0.]]) >>> a[0] = [12] >>> a[1] = [23] >>> a array([[ 1. 2.] [ 2. 3.] [ 0. 0.] [ 0. 0.] [ 0. 0.]]) There is also numpy.empty() if you don't need to zero the array. What's the benefit of using empty() over zeros()? that if you're going to initialize it with your data straight away you save the cost of zeroing it.  To create an empty multidimensional array in NumPy (e.g. a 2D array m*n to store your matrix) in case you don't know m how many rows you will append and don't care about the computational cost Stephen Simmons mentioned (namely re-buildinging the array at each append) you can squeeze to 0 the dimension to which you want to append to: X = np.empty(shape=[0 n]). This way you can use for example (here m = 5 which we assume we didn't know when creating the empty matrix and n = 2): n = 2 X = np.empty(shape=[0 n]) for i in range(5): for j in range(2): X = np.append(X [[i j]] axis=0) print X which will give you: [[ 0. 0.] [ 0. 1.] [ 1. 0.] [ 1. 1.] [ 2. 0.] [ 2. 1.] [ 3. 0.] [ 3. 1.] [ 4. 0.] [ 4. 1.]]  If you absolutely don't know the final size of the array you can increment the size of the array like this: my_arr = numpy.zeros((05)) for i in range(3): my_arr=numpy.concatenate( ( my_arr numpy.ones((15)) ) ) print(my_arr) [[ 1. 1. 1. 1. 1.] [ 1. 1. 1. 1. 1.] [ 1. 1. 1. 1. 1.]] Notice the 0 in the first line. numpy.append is another option. It calls numpy.concatenate.  You can use the append function. For rows: >>> from numpy import * >>> a = array([102030]) >>> append(a [[123]] axis=0) array([[10 20 30] [1 2 3]]) For columns: >>> append(a [[15][15]] axis=1) array([[10 20 30 15] [1 2 3 15]]) EDIT Of course as mentioned in other answers unless you're doing some processing (ex. inversion) on the matrix/array EVERY time you append something to it I would just create a list append to it then convert it to an array.  I looked into this a lot because I needed to use a numpy.array as a set in one of my school projects and I needed to be initialized empty... I didn't found any relevant answer here on Stack Overflow so I started doodling something. # Initialize your variable as a empty list first In [32]: x=[] # and now cast it as a numpy ndarray In [33]: x=np.array(x) The result will be: In [34]: x Out[34]: array([] dtype=float64) Therefore you can directly initialize an np array as follows: In [36]: x= np.array([] dtype=np.float64) I hope this helps.,python arrays numpy,1.3069829987394303E-4,0.002870884875679845,0.018786371944307892,0.9782120448801384
933020,Macro use depending on integer I have to use a macro multiple times inside a function and the macro that needs to be used depends on a number I pass into the function. e.g.  function(int number) { switch(number) { case 0: doStuff(MACRO0); break; case 1: doStuff(MACRO1); break; } } The problem is: I have a lot stuff to do per switch statement with the same macro. Is there are more elegant solution then having all that stuff in the switch statement? Like passing the macro itself to the function? I have read about eval() like methods in C++ but they just don't feel right to me. Another way could be do determine into what the macro expands but I haven't found any info on this. Oh it's openGL actually. This very much depends on what MACRO1 expands to. If it's a constant you can just call the function outside of the switch or do multiple fall-through cases. If it depends on the local context then you will have to evaluate it every time.  I would use a function object struct Method1 { void operator()() { ... } }; template<typename Method> void function(Method m) { ... m(); ... } int main() { function(Method1()); } Why not just use a function pointer? Because function objects using op() are faster and can be inlined. Given that he is doing OpenGL i think speed matters.  In addition to the above suggestions often I find using virtual inheritance can get rid of long conditionals especially switches-over-enums type code.

401598,"How can I get the length of a JTextField's contents as the user types? JTextField has a keyTyped event but it seems that at the time it fires the contents of the cell have not yet changed. Because of that .length() is always wrong if read here. There must be a simple way of getting the length as it appears to the user after a key stroke? Use this code: public void jTextField6KeyReleased(java.awt.event.KeyEvent evt) { System.out.println(jTextField6.getText().length()); } Consider expanding your answer to explain to the asker why this achieves the desired result possibly linking to documentation. As is this is only marginally useful.  KeyEvents are low-level events that are not appropriate here [that sounds familiar]. How does the JTextField system know that a character has been typed? Through a key typed event (IIRC done through the PL&F). Does the event get dispatched to the system listener before your listener? It might or might not do. In this case you probably want to go to the Document and add a higher-level listener. With Swing it's a good idea to go for the model early - the 'J' class interfaces are incoherent. If you are intercepting input data then you probably want a custom model (or in the case of Document a DocumentFilter).  This may be related to this ""bug"" (or rather ""feature"") The listeners are notified of the key events prior to processing them to allow the listeners to ""steal"" the events by consuming them. This gives compatibility with the older awt notion of consuming events. The ""typed"" event does not mean text was entered into the component. This is NOT a bug it is intended behavior. A possible solution is to listen to an associated Document // Listen for changes in the text myTextField.getDocument().addDocumentListener(new DocumentListener() { public void changedUpdate(DocumentEvent e) { // text was changed } public void removeUpdate(DocumentEvent e) { // text was deleted } public void insertUpdate(DocumentEvent e) { // text was inserted } }); Note this works no matter how the text gets changed; via a clipboard cut/paste progamatic ""setText()"" on the TextField or the user typing into the field on the UI.

1929045,Implementing tridiagonal matrix algorithm (TDMA) with NumPy I'm implementing TDMA in Python using NumPy. The tridiagonal matrix is stored in three arrays: a = array([...]) b = array([...]) c = array([...]) I'd like to calculate alpha-coefficients efficiently. The algorithm is as follows: # n = size of the given matrix - 1 alpha = zeros(n) alpha[0] = b[0] / c[0] for i in range(n-1): alpha[i+1] = b[i] / (c[i] - a[i] * alpha[i]) However this is not efficient because of Python's for loop. Want I want is something like this approach: # n = size of the given matrix - 1 alpha = zeros(n) alpha[0] = b[0] / c[0] alpha[1:] = b[1:] / (c[1:] - a[1:] * alpha[:-1]) In this latter case the result is incorrect because NumPy stores the right part of the last expression in a temprorary array and then assigns references to its elements to alpha[1:]. Therefore a[1:] * alpha[:-1] is just an array of zeros. Is there a way to tell NumPy to use values of alpha calculated on previous steps within its internal loop? Thanks. this isn't possible. see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1587367/python-numpy-tricky-slicing-problem for a similar issue. if you really need the speed increase try cython.

2677322,"Which MySql line is faster: I have a classified_id variable which matches one document in a MySql table. I am currently fetching the information about that one record like this:  SELECT * FROM table WHERE table.classified_id = $classified_id I wonder if there is a faster approach for example like this:  SELECT 1 FROM table WHERE table.classified_id = $classified_id Wont the last one only select 1 record which is exactly what I need so that it doesn't have to scan the entire table but instead stops searching for records after 1 is found? Or am I dreaming this? Thanks Is there a unique or primary key constraint on `classified_id`? You should add an index to the classified_id column to avoid a table scan. CREATE INDEX classified_idx ON table (classified_id); +1 Always good advice Not always though. With many inserts it can do some bad things Agree with `Col. Shrapnel` might be a bad idea when the field is the primary key. OP mentioned that the field value identified the row uniquely.  You want to use LIMIT: SELECT * FROM table WHERE table.classified_id = $classified_id LIMIT 1 will this improve performance? @Camran - Hard to say your current version will literally select ""1"" a one column one row result this will actually select the first record which seems to be what you want...but it is a different result. You won't get performance *better* (or simpler) than this so I'd go with it. @John I would say that this is not the answer the question states that there is only one record satisfying the query so LIMIT will make no difference  Why don't you try it? SELECT 1 FROM table; returns +---+ | 1 | +---+ | 1 | | 1 | | 1 | | 1 | | 1 | | 1 | +---+ 6 rows in set (0.00 sec) which is a computed column a constant value of one in this case (for all 6 rows in my test case). For your question SELECT * FROM table WHERE table.classified_id = $classified_id this is the fastest way to retrieve data (assuming that you need all the columns from the table) There are following things that you can do: check if there is an index on classified_id if there is and if using the index is faster the database will use the index and not scan the whole table so you'll get what you want (using index can be slower if there are just a few records or if a high percentage of records satisfy a criteria but having index will not bring any penalty to reading data database will chose the best way to retrieve it) if you don't need all the columns from the table then specify exactly which ones you need if there is more then one record that satisfy the criteria you can use LIMIT keyword to get only one or only a few records other then this for such a simple query the only next step would be to partition the table to several hard drives (which might not be an option on your system).  Yes you're dreaming this. There are 2 major faults in your reasoning: The question itself. Most newbies fail to that hole though. They ask ""what if I do something - will it be faster?"". But the proper question is ""My application Runs slow. How to find a bottleneck?"" and ""I have certain bottleneck. How to eliminate it?"" You suppose fieldlist part influencing database search.

See the code below for a simple example: from hashlib import sha1 from numpy import all array uint8 class hashable(object): r'''Hashable wrapper for ndarray objects. Instances of ndarray are not hashable meaning they cannot be added to sets nor used as keys in dictionaries. This is by design - ndarray objects are mutable and therefore cannot reliably implement the __hash__() method. The hashable class allows a way around this limitation. It implements the required methods for hashable objects in terms of an encapsulated ndarray object. This can be either a copied instance (which is safer) or the original object (which requires the user to be careful enough not to modify it).

For a 3x3 array the fastest version is the iterator version: y = set(x.flat) which I would recommend because it is the less memory expensive version (it scales up well with the size of the array). PS: There is also a NumPy function that does something similar: y = numpy.unique(x) This does produce a NumPy array with the same element as set(x.flat) but as a NumPy array. This is very fast (almost 10 times faster) but if you need a set then doing set(numpy.unique(x)) is a bit slower than the other procedures (building a set comes with a large overhead). @musicinmybrain: very good points! Thank you! Good suggestion! You could also use set(x.ravel()) which does the same thing but creates a copy only if needed.

378161,"In Java Swing how can you manage a list of panels allowing multiple panels to be selected? I��m working on an in-house app that tracks a bunch of tasks. I wanted to have a simple task monitor that would list the task name and the task��s status. I need this to look just a little nice I��m no designer so whatever I do is going to suck but a basic text display won��t work for the project requirements. What I am essentially attempting to do is show something similar to the Firefox download window the I-Tunes download window and well I could name more but they all look basically the same. In each of these apps each of the ���progress panels�� is selectable. So to implement this I thought it would be simple to just use a list of JPanels each with a JProgressBar and a JLabel each of which can just accept focus to determine if it and others are selected. I thought this was going to be an easy task but if I use a JList it just displays text. I then just figured I would show all the task panels in a larger panel but I cannot get the inner panels to recognize focus. Is there a pattern for this? Is there a rolled standard solution that I just have not found? Or is there a better method for doing this? I don��t want to re-invent the wheel but I thought this was just going to be simple. The standard way of doing this kind of things is to use JTable (or JList) as a container. You don't have to use default renderes fot table cells but you can specify your own renderer for specific cells. Take a look at CellRenderer  It sounds like what you may be looking for is an JList. You can add your items to the JList's by first adding your ""task"" to the JList object's ListModel (see the Create a Model section from The Java Tutorials) and then you'll want to assigned a custom ListCellRenderer which will accept your ""task"" and render on the JList as a JPanel in the list itself. The key here is to make your custom ListCellRenderer be able to display your ""task"" in the JList the way you want to have it show on the JList. Take a look into the Writing a Custom Cell Renderer section from the How to Use Lists page of The Java Tutorials. It will describe how to make your custom ListCellRenderer so you can represent your ""task"" as anything you want. To keep it short you will implement the ListCellRenderer interface by implementing the getListCellRendererComponent which will return a Component which is the representation of your task in the JList. You'll probably want to either construct or instantiate your JPanel in this method and return it as the Component. Here's some simple code showing how to render JPanels in a JList as alluded to in the answer: http://www.rgagnon.com/javadetails/java-0203.html  How about a JTable (which you can set to allow multiple rows to be selected) with an internal JPanel occupying the single cell in each row which contains a JProgressBar and a JLabel.

751840,How do I make textures transparent in OpenGL? I've tried to research this on Google but there doesn't appear to me to be any coherent simple answers. Is this because it's not simple or because I'm not using the correct keywords? Nevertheless this is the progress I've made so far. Created 8 vertices to form 2 squares. Created a texture with a 200 bit alpha value (so about 80% transparent). Assigned the same texture to each square which shows correctly. Noticed that when I use a texture with 255 alpha it appears brighter. The init is something like the following: glClearColor(0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0); glShadeModel(GL_FLAT); glEnable(GL_DEPTH_TEST); glEnable(GL_CULL_FACE); glEnable(GL_BLEND); glBlendFunc(GL_SRC_ALPHA GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA); glPixelStorei(GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT 1); glGenTextures(1 textureIds); glTexEnvf(GL_TEXTURE_ENV GL_TEXTURE_ENV_MODE GL_REPLACE); int i j; GLubyte pixel; for (i = 0; i < TEXTURE_HEIGHT; i++) { for (j = 0; j < TEXTURE_WIDTH; j++) { pixel = ((((i & 0x8) == 0) ^ ((j & 0x8) == 0)) * 255); texture[i][j][0] = pixel; texture[i][j][1] = pixel; texture[i][j][2] = pixel; texture[i][j][3] = 200; } } glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D textureIds[0]); glTexParameterf(GL_TEXTURE_2D GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S GL_REPEAT); glTexParameterf(GL_TEXTURE_2D GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T GL_REPEAT); glTexParameterf(GL_TEXTURE_2D GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER GL_NEAREST); glTexParameterf(GL_TEXTURE_2D GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER GL_NEAREST); glTexImage2D( GL_TEXTURE_2D 0 GL_RGBA TEXTURE_WIDTH TEXTURE_HEIGHT 0 GL_RGBA GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE texture); This is somewhat similar to the code snippet from page 417 in the book OpenGL Programming Guide and creates a check pattern. And then the display function contains... glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT); glEnable(GL_TEXTURE_2D); // Use model view so that rotation value is literal not added. glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW); glPushMatrix(); // ... translation etc ... glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D textureIds[0]); glBegin(GL_QUADS); glTexCoord2f(0.0 0.0); glVertex3f(-1.0 +1.0 0.0); // top left glTexCoord2f(0.0 1.0); glVertex3f(-1.0 -1.0 0.0); // bottom left glTexCoord2f(1.0 1.0); glVertex3f(+1.0 -1.0 0.0); // bottom right glTexCoord2f(1.0 0.0); glVertex3f(+1.0 +1.0 0.0); // top right glEnd(); // not neccecary to repeat just good practice glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D textureIds[0]); glBegin(GL_QUADS); glTexCoord2f(0.0 0.0); glVertex3f(-0.5 +1.0 -1.0); // top left glTexCoord2f(0.0 1.0); glVertex3f(-0.5 -1.0 -1.0); // bottom left glTexCoord2f(1.0 1.0); glVertex3f(+1.5 -1.0 -1.0); // bottom right glTexCoord2f(1.0 0.0); glVertex3f(+1.5 +1.0 -1.0); // top right glEnd(); glFlush(); glDisable(GL_TEXTURE_2D); glPopMatrix(); SwapBuffers(); So this renders a 2nd square in the background; I can see this but it looks like they're being blended with the background (I assume this because they are darker with 200 bit alpha than 255 bit) instead of the texture behind... As you can see no transparency... How can I fix this? You have TEXTURE_HEIGHT twice in that loop instead of TEXTURE_WIDTH Ah thanks but that won't matter as they're both 64. So the other answer which was here but was deleted mentioned this - Generally for alpha blending to work correctly you need to sort the objects from far to near in the coordinate system of the camera. This is why your polygons are blended with the background. You can confirm that this is indeed the problem by disabling the depth test. Without depth test all the fragments are displayed and you'll be able to see the alpha blending.

525227,"Console menu updating OpenGL window I am making an application that does some custom image processing. The program will be driven by a simple menu in the console. The user will input the filename of an image and that image will be displayed using openGL in a window. When the user selects some processing to be done to the image the processing is done and the openGL window should redraw the image. My problem is that my image is never drawn to the window instead the window is always black. I think it may have to do with the way I am organizing the threads in my program. The main execution thread handles the menu input/output and the image processing and makes calls to the Display method while a second thread runs the openGL mainloop. Here is my main code: #include <iostream> #include <GL/glut.h> #include ""ImageProcessor.h"" #include ""BitmapImage.h"" using namespace std; DWORD WINAPI openglThread( LPVOID param ); void InitGL(); void Reshape( GLint newWidth GLint newHeight ); void Display( void ); BitmapImage* b; ImageProcessor ip; int main( int argc char *argv[] ) { DWORD threadID; b = new BitmapImage(); CreateThread( 0 0 openglThread NULL 0 &threadID ); while( true ) { char choice; string path = ""TestImages\\""; string filename; cout << ""Enter filename: ""; cin >> filename; path += filename; b = new BitmapImage( path ); Display(); cout << ""1) Invert"" << endl; cout << ""2) Line Thin"" << endl; cout << ""Enter choice: ""; cin >> choice; if( choice == '1' ) { ip.InvertColour( *b ); } else { ip.LineThinning( *b ); } Display(); } return 0; } void InitGL() { int argc = 1; char* argv[1]; argv[0] = new char[20]; strcpy( argv[0] ""main"" ); glutInit( &argc argv ); glutInitDisplayMode( GLUT_DOUBLE | GLUT_RGB | GLUT_DEPTH); glutInitWindowPosition( 0 0 ); glutInitWindowSize( 800 600 ); glutCreateWindow( ""ICIP Program - Character recognition using line thinning Hilbert curve and wavelet approximation"" ); glutDisplayFunc( Display ); glutReshapeFunc( Reshape ); glClearColor(0.00.00.01.0); glEnable(GL_DEPTH_TEST); } void Reshape( GLint newWidth GLint newHeight ) { /* Reset viewport and projection parameters */ glViewport( 0 0 newWidth newHeight ); } void Display( void ) { glClear (GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT); // Clear display window. b->Draw(); glutSwapBuffers(); } DWORD WINAPI openglThread( LPVOID param ) { InitGL(); glutMainLoop(); return 0; } Here is my draw method for BitmapImage: void BitmapImage::Draw() { cout << ""Drawing"" << endl; if( _loaded ) { glBegin( GL_POINTS ); for( unsigned int i = 0; i < _height * _width; i++ ) { glColor3f( _bitmap_image[i*3] / 255.0 _bitmap_image[i*3+1] / 255.0 _bitmap_image[i*3+2] / 255.0 ); // invert the y-axis while drawing glVertex2i( i % _width _height - (i / _width) ); } glEnd(); } } Any ideas as to the problem? Edit: The problem was technically solved by starting a glutTimer from the openglThread which calls glutPostRedisplay() every 500ms. This is OK for now but I would prefer a solution in which I only have to redisplay every time I make changes to the bitmap (to save on processing time) and one in which I don't have to run another thread (the timer is another thread im assuming). This is mainly because the main processing thread is going to be doing a lot of intensive work and I would like to dedicate most of the resources to this thread rather than anything else. You need to make OpenGL calls on the thread in which context was created (glutInitDisplayMode). Hence glXX calls inside Display method which is on different thread will not be defined. You can see this easily by dumping the function address hopefully it would be undefined or NULL.  It sounds like the 500ms timer is calling Display() regularly after 2 calls it fills the back-buffer and the front-buffer with the same rendering. Display() continues to be called until the user enters something which the OpenGL thread never knows about but since global variable b is now different the thread blindly uses that in Display(). So how about doing what Jesse Beder says and use a global int call it flag to flag when the user entered something. For example: set flag = 1; after you do the b = new BitmapImage( path ); then set flag = 0; after you call Display() from the OpenGL thread. You loop on the timer but now check if flag = 1. You only need call glutPostRedisplay() when flag = 1 i.e. the user entered something. Seems like a good way without using a sleep/wake mechanism. Accessing global variables among more than one thread can also be unsafe. I think the worst that can happen here is the OpenGL thread miss-reads flag = 0 when it should read flag = 1. It should then catch it after no more than a few iterations. If you get strange behavior go to synchronization. With the code you show you call Display() twice in main(). Actually main() doesn't even need to call Display() the OpenGL thread does it.  Your problem may be in Display() at the line b->Draw(); I don't see where b is passed into the scope of Display(). b is declared globally just above main() Yes I see it now in the morning light.  I've had this problem before - it's pretty annoying. The problem is that all of your OpenGL calls must be done in the thread where you started the OpenGL context. So when you want your main (input) thread to change something in the OpenGL thread you need to somehow signal to the thread that it needs to do stuff (set a flag or something). Note: I don't know what your BitmapImage loading function (here your constructor) does but it probably has some OpenGL calls in it. The above applies to that too! So you'll need to signal to the other thread to create a BitmapImage for you or at least to do the OpenGL-related part of creating the bitmap. That's not entirely accurate the requirement is that the OpenGL context can only be _current_ to any single thread. The context can however be created in a different thread than which it is current. This is useful for offscreen rendering for example. Just to clarify the problem in this case is definitely the multithreaded rendering though since the OP is making gl calls from different threads using the same context or rather a non-existent context (in the main thread). Re comment #1 that's true but I thought it was irrelevant (and unnecessary complication) for this particular example.  A few points: Generally if you're going the multithreaded route it's preferable if your main thread is your GUI thread i.e. it does minimal tasks keeping the GUI responsive. In your case I would recommend moving the intensive image processing tasks into a thread and doing the OpenGL rendering in your main thread. For drawing your image you're using vertices instead of a textured quad. Unless you have a very good reason it's much faster to use a single textured quad (the processed image being the texture). Check out glTexImage2D and glTexSubImage2D. Rendering at a framerate of 2fps (500ms as you mentioned) will have negligible impact on resources if you're using an OpenGL implementation that is accelerated which is almost guaranteed on any modern system and if you use a textured quad instead of a vertex per pixel.",c++ multithreading opengl console,0.6607208919727051,0.33896426404308133,1.658780051655834E-4,1.489659790478656E-4
1613249,"NumPy: Comparing Elements in Two Arrays Anyone ever come up to this problem? Let's say you have two arrays like the following a = array([123456]) b = array([145]) Is there a way to compare what elements in a exist in b? For example c = a == b # Wishful example here print c array([145]) # Or even better array([True False False True True False]) I'm trying to avoid loops as it would take ages with millions of elements. Any ideas? Cheers what data do you have in the arrays? Index-like unique integers like the example? Numpy has a set function numpy.setmember1d() that works on sorted and uniqued arrays and returns exactly the boolean array that you want. If the input arrays don't match the criteria you'll need to convert to the set format and invert the transformation on the result. import numpy as np a = np.array([6123456]) b = np.array([145]) # convert to the uniqued form a_set a_inv = np.unique1d(a return_inverse=True) b_set = np.unique1d(b) # calculate matching elements matches = np.setmea_set b_set) # invert the transformation result = matches[a_inv] print(result) # [False True False False True True False] Edit: Unfortunately the setmember1d method in numpy is really inefficient. The search sorted and assign method you proposed works faster but if you can assign directly you might as well assign directly to the result and avoid lots of unnecessary copying. Also your method will fail if b contains anything not in a. The following corrects those errors: result = np.zeros(a.shape dtype=np.bool) idxs = a.searchsorted(b) idxs = idxs[np.where(idxs < a.shape[0])] # Filter out out of range values idxs = idxs[np.where(a[idxs] == b)] # Filter out where there isn't an actual match result[idxs] = True print(result) My benchmarks show this at 91us vs. 6.6ms for your approach and 109ms for numpy setmember1d on 1M element a and 100 element b. That's a nice solution. I'll try out your suggestion and what I just wrote to see what's more optimal in speed. Many thanks everyone for your help! The method I wrote is a bit faster. For a 10000 element array the time it took using timeit in iPython is roughly 3 ��s. The setmember1d method took 3 ms. I think your method is more elegant but I need the speed. you forgot to close a parenthesis in the 3rd line. you should fix it before some computer science professor notices it... ebressert: seems that you're right setmember1d has an absolutely terrible implementation in numpy. But the method you're using seems to be using nan values for no good reason you might just as well use the result array directly. I'll edit with the corresponding example. Ants Aasma: Your edit is good. I implemented pieces of it to my code and increased the speed once more. Rather than doing nans I put in -1 and then filtered on match = b >= 0. I'm dealing with indexing in my case so there are no indexes of -1. That's why I used np.nan which would work for the more general case. Thanks for your input. My code is really flying now.  Your example implies set-like behavior caring more about existance in the array than having the right element at the right place. Numpy does this differently with its mathematical arrays and matrices it will tell you only about items at the exact right spot. Can you make that work for you? >>> import numpy >>> a = numpy.array([123]) >>> b = numpy.array([133]) >>> a == b array([ True False True] dtype=bool) sorry this example doesn't work if you try it; moreover you would have to sort the arrays first. @dalloligom: Uh I copied from my interactive session so at least it works exactly like that for some version of Python and Numpy. ok but it doesn't work if the two arrays have different length; in any case you have to sort them first (try array([123])==array([231]). he wants to know which elements of an array exists in another. and by the way even sorting the arrays won't work... you have to use a set structure. @dalloliogm: Did you read my answer? Does it seem like I didn't understand all that?  Thanks for your reply kaizer.se. It's not quite what I was looking for but with a suggestion from a friend and what you said I came up with the following. import numpy as np a = np.array([145]).astype(np.float32) b = np.arange(10).astype(np.float32) # Assigning matching values from a in b as np.nan b[b.searchsorted(a)] = np.nan # Now generating Boolean arrays match = np.isnan(b) nonmatch = match == False It's a bit of a cumbersome process but it beats writing loops or using weave with loops. Cheers  Use np.intersect1d. #!/usr/bin/env python import numpy as np a = np.array([123456]) b = np.array([145]) c=np.intersect1d(ab) print(c) # [1 4 5] Note that np.intersect1d gives the wrong answer if a or b have nonunique elements. In that case use np.intersect1d_nu. There is also np.setdiff1d setxor1d setmember1d and union1d. See Numpy Example List With Doc +1: Excellent. The right function for this task.  Actually there's an even simpler solution than any of these: import numpy as np a = array([123456]) b = array([145]) c = np.in1d(ab) The resulting c is then: array([ True False False True True False] dtype=bool) Is there an ""almost_equal"" version of this? Where you can specify the condition used to test for equality?  ebresset your answer won't work unless a is a subset of b (and a and b are sorted). Otherwise the searchsorted will return false indices. I had to do something similar and combining that with your code: # Assume a and b are sorted idxs = numpy.mod(b.searchsorted(a)len(b)) idxs = idxs[b[idxs]==a] b[idxs] = numpy.nan match = numpy.isnan(b)",python numpy,1.7800827701668987E-4,2.902983347309715E-4,2.481386616347108E-4,0.9992835547266177

I want to select them based on classified_id and cat_id so let's say cat_id = 1 and classified_id = 22 Then there is imo no real reason to have a `value_id` as both `option_id` and `classified_id` would make a primary key for the option values..

Column names for PK columns -- just call all of them ""id"". Reduces the number of things you have to remember. Eliminates a major source of confusion and potential bugs. Make table names consistent. I mean make them all the same form. You could make them all a singular noun or all a plural noun but just make them all the same. Queries become easier to write and easier to understand. classifieds categories category_options option_values Column names for FK cols -- like this: parent_table_id. For example: classified.category_id. Eliminate any verbiage that doesn't contain new information. For example category.name instead of category.cat_name. re (1): I disagree. Especially when dealing with joins it is a *lot* easier to have unique names for the *id* columns so you can easily see which ids should be interpreted the same. I agree with (4) as those won't make an index but for indexed columns it is better to have unique names that spread over all tables where the same id is meant.  You actually don't even need to explicitely specify the join here. It's just as simple that you want to get values from two tables (options and their values) where the option_ids are identical and select only thos results where your cat & classified id matches. SELECT cat_id classified_id option_id option_name value FROM option_values category_options WHERE category_options.option_id = option_values.option_id AND classified_id = <?> AND cat_id = <?> Hi... This works fine thanks... But what If I would like to insert an ad. I know how to insert into the classifieds table but I don't know how to insert the values of the option_values because there are more than one row that needs to be inserted. The classifieds table is easy because it's just one row but the option_values table has multiple rows per classified_id. Could you make a Insert statement for me as well? Thanks For inserting just execute the same insert statement multiple times (which changed values of course). Or you can use the syntax to add multiple values at once (`INSERT INTO tbl ( col1 col2 col3 ) VALUES ( row1-1 row1-2 row1-3 ) ( row2-1 row2-2 row2-3) ...`) but most times that is not really the easiest way when working with dynamic content (it's easy to use that syntax when you know how many rows will be inserted but for a dynamic number just insert one row per statement).",php sql mysql database,1.9417426720116078E-4,0.008213700889816117,0.99134904765418,2.430771888026349E-4

For example: ---%<--- main/RandomClass.java // ... if (...is JDK 6+...) { try { JDK6Interface i = (JDK6Interface) Class.forName(""JDK6Impl"").newInstance(); i.browseDesktop(...); } catch (Exception x) { // fall back... } } ---%<--- main/JDK6Interface.java public interface JDK6Interface { void browseDesktop(URI uri); } ---%<--- jdk6/JDK6Impl.java public class JDK6Impl implements JDK6Interface { public void browseDesktop(URI uri) { java.awt.Desktop.getDesktop().browse(uri); } } ---%<--- You could configure these as separate projects in an IDE using different JDKs etc. The point is that the main root can be compiled independently and it is very clear what you can use in which root whereas if you try to compile different parts of a single root separately it is too easy to accidentally ""leak"" usage of JDK 6 into the wrong files. Rather than using Class.forName like this you can also use some kind of service registration system - java.util.ServiceLoader (if main could use JDK 6 and you wanted optional support for JDK 7!) NetBeans Lookup Spring etc. etc. The same technique can be used to create support for an optional library rather than a newer JDK.  You can do all of your compiling exclusively on Java6 and then use System.getProperty(""java.version"") to conditionally run either the Java5 or the Java6 code path. You can have Java6-only code in a class and the class will run fine on Java5 as long as the Java6-only code path is not executed. This is a trick that is used to write applets that will run on the ancient MSJVM all the way up to brand-new Java Plug-in JVMs.  This will make all the Java purists cringe (which is fun heh heh) but i would use the C preprocessor put #ifdefs in my source. A makefile rakefile or whatever controls your build would have to run cpp to make a temporary files to feed the compiler. I have no idea if ant could be made to do this. While stackoverflow looks like it'll be the place for all answers you could wehn no one's looking mosey on over to http://www.javaranch.com for Java wisdom. I imagine this question has been dealt with there prolly a long time ago.  I think the best approach here is probably to use build scripts. You can have all your code in one location and by choosing which files to include and which not to include you can choose what version of your code to compile. Note that this may not help if you need finer-grained control than per file.  A simple solution could be: Place the divergent classes outside of your normal classpath. Write a simple custom classloader and install it in main as your default. For all classes apart from the 5/6 ones the cassloader can defer to its parent (the normal system classloader) For the 5/6 ones (which should be the only ones that cannot be found by the parent) it can decide which to use via the 'os.name' property or one of your own.  Assuming that the classes have similar functionality with 1.5 vs. 6.0 differences in implementation you could merge them into one class. Then without editing the source to comment/uncomment you can rely on the optimization that the compiler always do. If an if expression is always false the code in the if statement will not be included in the compilation. You can make a static variable in one of your classes to determine which version you want to run: public static final boolean COMPILED_IN_JAVA_6 = false; And then have the affected classes check that static variable and put the different sections of code in a simple if statement if (VersionUtil.COMPILED_IN_JAVA_6) { // Java 6 stuff goes here } else { // Java 1.5 stuff goes here } Then when you want to compile the other version you just have to change that one variable and recompile. It might make the java file larger but it will consolidate your code and eliminate any code duplication that you have. Your editor may complain about unreachable code or whatever but the compiler should blissfully ignore it. Is that a documented behaviour of Java compilers? This answer seems incorrect. I did a quick Java app that used java.io.Console and the above approach. The compiler failed in 1.5 with an error like the following: Test.java:8: cannot find symbol: method console() location: class java.lang.System I could see how you could compile in 1.6 and exclude certain runtime features when running in a 1.5 JVM. Of course you would also need to re-compile into 1.5 JVM bytecode format to avoid the ""invalid minor version 49.0"" error. For that approach this solution could work. This answer *is* incorrect. The Java 5 compiler will fail to compile the ""Java 6 stuff goes here"" block so you haven't fixed the problem. A better solution would be to have two implementations of an interface one for Java 5 and one for Java 6. Your build tool can then include the right implementation at compile time. Ant could do this easily by using a build property.  You can probably refactor your code so that conditional compile really isn't needed just conditional classloading. Something like this: public interface Opener{ public void open(File f); public static class Util{ public Opener getOpener(){ if(System.getProperty(""java.version"").beginsWith(""1.5"")){ return new Java5Opener(); } try{ return new Java6Opener(); }catch(Throwable t){ return new Java5Opener(); } } } } This could be a lot of effort depending on how many version-specific pieces of code you have.  It depends on what Java 6 features you want to use. For a simple thing like adding row sorters to JTables you can actually test at runtime: private static final double javaVersion = Double.parseDouble(System.getProperty(""java.version"").substring(0 3)); private static final boolean supportsRowSorter = (javaVersion >= 1.6); //... if (supportsRowSorter) { myTable.setAutoCreateRowSorter(true); } else { // not supported } This code must be compiled with Java 6 but can be run with any version (no new classes are referenced). EDIT: to be more correct it will work with any version since 1.3 (according to this page).  You can use reflection API. put all your 1.5 code in one class and 1.6 api in another. In your ant script create two targets one for 1.5 that won't compile the 1.6 class and one for 1.6 that won't compile the class for 1.5. in your code check your java version and load the appropriate class using reflection that way javac won't complain about missing functions. This is how i can compile my MRJ(Mac Runtime for Java) applications on windows.  The suggestions about using custom class loaders and dynamically commented code are a bit incredulous when it comes to maintenance and the preservation of the sanity of whichever poor soul picks up the project after you shuffle to pastures new. The solution is easy. Pull the affected classes out into two separate independent projects - make sure the package names are the same and just compile into jars that you can then consume in your main project. If you keep the package names the same and the method signatures the same no problems - just drop whichever version of the jar you need into your deployment script. I would assume you run separate build scripts or have separate targets in the same script - ant and maven can both easily handle conditionally grabbing files and copying them. Independent projects are overkill separate source folders and a custom build script will do just fine. Use source folders for src/main with the common codebase and say src/java5 and src/java6 for features dependent on each version.  The public static final solution mentioned above has one additional benefit the author didn't mention--as I understand it the compiler will recognize it at compile time and compile out any code that is within an if statement that refers to that final variable. So I think that's the exact solution you were looking for.  You can get conditional compile but not very nicely - javac will ignore unreachable code. Thus if you structured your code properly you can get the compiler to ignore parts of your code. To use this properly you would also need to pass the correct arguments to javac so it doesn't report unreachable code as errors and refuse to compile :-)  There is no pre-compiler in Java. Thus no way to do a #ifdef like in C. Build scripts would be the best way. He's suggesting to use s C compiler to run the actual C pre-processor which would output modified source files then run the Java compiler on those. Most if not all C compilers have a switch to run the pre-processor only.",java swing compilation,1.0638283611457638E-4,0.9390401071973393,0.0563937602705123,0.004459749696033736
1382846,How can I create a numpy array holding values of a multi-variable function? I want to create an array holding a function f(xyz). If it were a function of one variable I'd do for instance: sinx = numpy.sin(numpy.linspace(-55100)) to get sin(x) for x in [-55] How can I do the same to get for instance sin(x+y+z)? What would be the values for xyz and/or how do you plan to generate them? xyz would be the cartesian product of `numpy.linspace(-55100)` over all three dimensions. I don't know the best way to generate them. I guess that's a pre-requisite for the question. xyz = numpy.mgrid[-5:5-5:5-5:5] sinxyz = numpy.sin(xyz[0]+xyz[1]+xyz[2])  I seem to have found a way: # define the range of xyz x_range = numpy.linspace(x_minx_maxx_num) y_range = numpy.linspace(y_miny_maxy_num) z_range = numpy.linspace(z_minz_maxz_num) # create arrays xyz in the correct dimensions # so that they create the grid xyz = numpy.ix_(x_rangey_rangez_range) # calculate the function of x y and z sinxyz = numpy.sin(x+y+z)  The numpy.mgrid function would work equally well: xyz = numpy.mgrid[x_min:x_max:x_num y_min:y_max:y_num z_min:z_max:z_num] sinxyz = numpy.sin(x+y+z) edit: to get it to work x_num y_num and z_num have to be explicit numbers followed by j e.g. xy = numpy.mgrid[-1:1:10j -1:1:10j],python function multidimensional-array numpy,4.904919918013061E-4,7.99901054069785E-4,6.837323995709944E-4,0.9980258745545579
295649,Adding rows to a JTable We have a simple project where we read data from a socket and we want to populate a table with the coming data but we can't find a way to add rows to a yet created JTable object we can only find how to add rows at creation time of the table. Is it possible to add rows dynamically to a JTable or there is a better alternative object to deal with this way of showing data? EDIT: Thanks a lot for your answers. All three of them look very promising but I have to choose only one and I think the best is Guillaume's. You should create a custom TableModel. A JTable doesn't actually store the rows it always delegates that to a TableModel. To help you implementing it you should make use of AbstractTableModel. Don't forget to call fireTableRowsInserted() every time you add rows. For better performances if you add a lot of rows try to batch the updates and add many rows at a time.  If you use the default table model for a JTable then you can add rows with following code  if ( dest+1 < table.getRowCount()-1 ) ( (DefaultTableModel) table.getModel() ).insertRow(dest+1 getValuesForNewRow()); else ( (DefaultTableModel) table.getModel() ).addRow(getValuesForNewRow()); It's best to just keep hold of the DefaultTableModel before passing it to the JTable constructor. Then you don't need to touch the JTable or do any casting.  Once you start dynamically adding and removing elements from a JTable you really need to start using a TableModel.

227526,"Bus or listeners/delegates in client-side Swing application? Building a client-side swing application what should be notified on a bus (application-wide message system similar in concept to JMS but much simpler) and what should be notified using direct listeners? When using a bus I always have an unescapable feeling of ""I have no idea who uses that and where"". Also no set order hard to veto events hard to know exactly what's going on at a set time. On the other hand using listeners means either directly referencing the source object (coupling) or passing the reference through myriad conversions (A--b_listener-->B B--c_listener-->C only because a needs to know something only C can to tell but B has no interest in). So are there any rule of the thumb regarding this? Any suggestion how to balance? In my experience trying to make Swing do something it wasn't designed for or doesn't want you to do is extremely painful. I would go with the simplest thing that would work; keep your code clean do it the ""Swing Way"" until you start seeing problems.  Well I can imagine the approach where models are updated using BUS like system and events from models are delegated using listeners. Simple scenario: I got server side which represents producer of data. Then on client side a got consumer interface which consumes all incoming messages and transform them into my internal messages/DTOs and push them into bus which distributes them into application model(s). These model process incoming messages and decide to notify interested components using listeners.  Event buses are very very useful tools for providing decoupling in certain architectures. Listeners are easy to implement but they have significant limitations when your object and dependency graph gets large. Listeners tend to run into problems with cyclic dependencies (events can 'bounce' in odd ways and you wind up having to play games to ensure that you don't get stuck. Most binding frameworks do this for you but there's something distasteful about knowing that listener events are shooting off into a million places). I make this kind of decision based on project size and scalability. If it's a big app or there are aspects of the app that can by dynamic (like plugin modules etc...) then a bus is a good way to keep the architecture clean (OSGI-like module containers are another approach but heavier weight). If you are considering a bus architecture I recommend that you take a look at the Event Bus project - it works very well with Swing and provides a robust out of the box solution for what you are asking about. Link [Event Bus](https://eventbus.dev.java.net/) is dead. Are you referring to [EventBus](http://www.eventbus.org/) or [simpleeventbus](http://code.google.com/p/simpleeventbus/) or something else? Whew - the code at EventBus looks the same as what I pointed at back in 2008 but I haven't followed the project that closely...  The convention in Java Swing is to use listeners heavily. Sticking with the convention improves maintainability but stifles innovation.

316454,"Can you set a permanent size for a JPanel inside of a JFrame? My current problem is that I have a JFrame with a 2x2 GridLayout. And inside one of the squares I have a JPanel that is to display a grid. I am having a field day with the java swing library... take a look Image Java is automatically expanding each JLabel to fit the screen. I want it to just be those blue squares (water) and the black border and not that gray space. Is there a way I can just set the size of that JPanel permanently so that I don't have to go through changing the size of the JFrame a million times before I get the exact dimension so that the gray space disappears? I also would like to set the size of those buttons so they are not so huge (BorderLayout is being used for the buttons and TextField) GridBagLayout is what you really want to use. The GridLayout will force the same size for each component in the layout no matter what size constraints you put on them. GridBagLayout is a lot more powerful and a lot more complicated. Study up on the API page for it. Using GridBagLayout the components won't fill the whole grid space if you don't want them to and can even stay the size that you ask it to be. To keep a component's size from changing I would set all three available size constraints: water.setPreferredSize(new Dimension(20 20)); water.setMinimumSize(new Dimension(20 20)); water.setMaximumSize(new Dimension(20 20)); For your buttons I would definitely use an inner panel as Bryan mentions. You could use either a GridLayout like he suggests or a FlowLayout if you don't want all the buttons to be the same size. Add all your buttons to that inner panel instead of the main one.  If you can setResizeable( false ) on the top level frame you can then set your layout manager to null and hard code each location and size via setBounds. This is how I would do it (contingent on resizing of course).  I have had success solving problems like these using TableLayout which is a third party layout manager. You will need to download it and read the tutorial but the key would be to set the justification to CENTER when adding the JButtons to their positions in the layout.  If you want the two checkerboards to stay the same size then you'll need to have them each contained in their own JPanel. Set each of those parent JPanel's to have a layout type of GridBagLayout. Set the preferedSize for each checkerboard component and then add them to their respective containers. GridBagLayout should by default lay each board out in the center of the parent JPanel. So as the window is resized the JPanel parent area will get larger or smaller but the checkerboard components inside will remain the same size. Alternatively you could have your blue squares scale to the right size as the window is resized by having each checkboard square be a JPanel with a BorderLayout layout manager and adding the JLabel (with a blue background color) to its BorderLayout.CENTER location. As for your buttons try something like this: JPanel theButtonPanel = new JPanel(new BorderLayout()); JButton button1 = new JButton(""Fire""); JButton button2 = new JButton(""Pass""); JButton button3 = new JButton(""Forfiet""); JPanel innerButtonContainer = new JPanel(new Grid(1 3 8 8)); innerButtonContainer.add(button1); innerButtonContainer.add(button2); innerButtonContainer.add(button3); theButtonPanel.add(innterButtonContainer); Lastly consider using a design tool for your Swing user interface.

115277,"Fast search in java swing applications? I'm wandering myself what component is the best for displaying fast search results in swing. I want to create something like this make a text field where user can enter some text during his entering I'll improve in back end fast search on database and I want to show data bellow the text box and he will be able to browse the results and on pres enter result will be displayed in table. So my question is is there any component which already have this logic for displaying? Or is it's not what is the best way to implement that. This search will be something what ajax gives me on web same logic same look and feel if it's possible on desktop application. You will have to first attach a listener to the JTextFields Document to be notified whenever the user types in the field (or changes it). From there you can fire off any server-side code you need. The results of that can be used to update a listbox. A few things to keep in mind: The code to do the search against the backend must be in another thread The code that updates the list box should update the list box's model You will need to manage all your backend search results so that you only update the listbox with the most recent result (e.g. user types 'A' backenf searches for that. Meanwhile user has typed 'C' kicking off a backend search for 'AC'. You need to ensure the results from the 'A' search dont' make it to the listbox if the 'AC' search results are available).  It is possible of course. It is simple too. For drop down list of terms just use popup menu. This is simple. The background processing of entered text is simple too. Enjoy!  Use Hibernate Search. The SwingHack (http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596009076/) book has an example of this.  In the interest of killing two birds with one stone: have a separate indexing thread. This will: Improve the speed of searches whenever they are executed. Improve the responsiveness of the UI since indexing is happening in a separate thread. Of course exactly how you perform the indexing will vary widely depending on your particular application. Here is a good place to start researching: Search Indexing. And please ignore the reference to Web 3.0 [sic].  Are you looking for something like an AutoComplete component for Java Swing? SwingX has such a component. See here for the JavaDoc. It has a lot of utility methods to do various things i.e. auto-completing a text box from the contents of a JList. Thanks for the tip. I downloaded the swingx classes and I tried: ArrayList nums = new ArrayList(); numsadd(new StringBuffer(""4000"")); nums.add(new StringBuffer(""5000"")); autoCompleteAdaptor = new TextComponentAdaptor(numsInputnums); where numsInput is a JTextField. I don't know what do I need to setup next. Do you happen to know where I can find a sample to get started ?

3057351,Large strings: Text files or SQL DB? I am coding a forum system using PHP. I am currently storing a threads ID title author views and other attributes in an SQL database and then storing the thread body (the HTML and BBcode) in text files inside a folder named after the thread ID. In practise it's really simple to grab the database values then just grab the thread body from the text file but I was wondering if this is the 'proper way'? I have personally no problems doing this but if it turns out it is massively inefficient and I should instead store both the thread body HTML and BBcode in the database instead then I will change. However to me it seems wrong to store such a (very possibly) huge string of multi-line text along with lots of different characters in a database - I was taught that databases are more for short field 'values' rather than website content. I would just like a definitive answer to this because it's been bugging me for ages as to wherever I��ve been doing it properly. Does anyone know how popular forum systems store threads? Added Thanks for the answers so it's best to store thread content in the database what field type should i use? Also what about replies? Another table which has the thread ID and comment ID then the comment body? I'm new to this database stuff so thanks for your help. Joomla - all the content is in the database. Drupal probably too. Countless systems store content in a database. (Beware this is only a statistic!) Best to ask a separate followup question for database design. There's no limit to how many questions you can ask and changing the criteria means those who originally provided answers could be downvoted -- we're not alerted when you update your question. Ok yeah i understand thanks! This is an aside as the question has already been accepted however you should check out phpbb3 (http://www.phpbb.com/). Very robust php forum. May save you some development time :D Thanks but the main purpose for me coding this forum is as a learning exercise for myself otherwise i would def use phpbb :)  Confluence (a commercial wiki) stores the entire page content within a single column. The reason to store large text in the database is: There's (hopefully) no disconnect between the value and the record(s) the text is associated with There are technologies like Full Text Search (FTS) to make finding specific strings in large amounts of text Simplified backup & restore process +1. I forgot about Confulence and we use it...  I know that DotNetNuke and the AspDotNetStorefront use a database to store such data. These aren't forums but a content management system and a shopping cart with content management capabilities. I've also experimented with several forums (Such as YAF) and all of those use databases as well. Personally I'd stick with a DB for the HTML and any image/content files should be stored on the disk with a reference to their location in HTML. Perhaps the strongest argument for storing in the DB: It's a heck of a lot easier to search the text fields with a LIKE clause than to search for a strong in a text file. Also with free forum software cout there can I ask why you're writing a new one from scratch? I realize there are probably good reasons but just in case it's something you hadn't thought of yet... Added Most of my references were .NET code. Here's an open source forum written in PHP: http://www.phorum.org/ And that LIKE clause can end up being very slow... You may want to use full text indexing for that. @Nelson - Good point! Thanks. Also i'm coding it myself mainly as a learning exercise it isn't a serious website so i thought i'd give it a go coding the system myself. That's good.. It's a good learning experience. Still it might not be too bad an idea to get the source code for phorum at some point and compare to see how you did compared to how they did... Looking at established code and comparing it with your own is a very good way to learn. Have fun!  It would be best practice to store the thread in the database since that will allow you to scale and search easier. If you want to continue using files to store the content I would recommend using something along the lines of GridFS. Basically just chunks up files and stores them in NOSQL.  I agree with the other answers storing all the data in your database simplify scaling backup/restore allows you to query the data and so on. If you're concerned with performance you could implement a cache for the page content. I know PHPBB does this by having a serialized array in a text file with a expiration timestamp. Could also be done using memcached or otherwise. Storing the data in a database give you the most flexibility and convenience most problems related to serving the data to the end-user can be handled by caching the data.,php sql database,2.0383229657489754E-4,0.26146204076044255,0.7380789593435226,2.5516759945992906E-4

I agree with Goz. You need to use homegenous 4x4 matrices if you want to represent affine transformations such as rotate + translate Assuming row major representation then if there is no scaling or shearing your 4x4 matrix represents the following: Rows 0 to 2 : The three basis vectors of your local co-ordinate system ( i.e xyz ) Row 3 : the current translation from the origin So to move along your local x vector as Goz says because you can assume it's a unit vector if there is no scale/shear you just multiply it by the move step ( +ve or -ve ) then add the resultant vector onto Row 4 in the matrix So taking a simple example of starting at the origin with your local frame set to world frame then your matrix would look something like this 1 0 0 0 <--- x unit vector 0 1 0 0 <--- y unit vector 0 0 1 0 <--- z unit vector 0 0 0 1 <--- translation vector In terms of a way most game cameras work then the axes map like this: x axis <=> Camera Pan Left/Right y axis <=> Camera Pan Up/Down z axis <=> Camera Zoom In/Out So if I rotate my entire frame of reference to say look at a new point LookAt then as Goz puts in his BaseCamera overloaded constructor code you then construct a new local co-ordinate system and set this into your matrix ( all mCameraMat.Set( vLat vUp vDir vPos ) does typically is set those four rows of the matrix i.e VLat would be row 0 vUp row 1 vDir row 2 and vPos row 3 ) Then to zoom in/out would just become row 3 = row 2 * stepval Again as Goz rightly points out you then need to transform this back into world-space and this is done by multiplying by the inverse of the view matrix Do bear in mind that the above code is for a row major matrix. You will need to transpose the matrix for a column major matrix :) Yep absolutely true  I'm not entirely sure what you are doing above. Personally I would just allow a simple 4x4 matrix. Any implementation will do. To rotate you simply need to rotate using the change of mouse x and y as euler inputs for rotation around the y and x axes. There is lots of code available all over the internet that will do this for you. Some of those matrix libraries won't provide you with a ""MoveForward()"" function. If this is the case its ok moving forward is pretty easy. The third column (or row if you are using row major matrices) is your forward vector. Extract it. Normalise it (It really should be normalised anyway so this step may not be needed). Multiply it by how much you wish to move forward and then add it to the position (the 4th column/row). Now here is the odd part. A view matrix is a special type of matrix. The matrix above defines the view space. If you multiply your current model matrix by this matrix you will not get the answer you expect. Because you wish to transform it such that the camera is at the origin. As such you need to effectively undo the camera transformation to re-orient things to the view defined above. To do this you multiply your model matrix by the inverse of the view matrix. You now have an object defined in the correct view space. This is my very simple camera class. It does not handle the functionality you describe but hopefully will give you a few ideas on how to set up the class (Be warned I use row major ie DirectX style matrices).

103179,"How do I set an Application's Icon Globally in Swing? I know I can specify one for each form or for the root form and then it'll cascade through to all of the children forms but I'd like to have a way of overriding the default Java Coffee Cup for all forms even those I might forget. Any suggestions? Extend the JDialog class (for example name it MyDialog) and set the icon in constructor. Then all dialogs should extend your implementation (MyDialog).  There is another way but its more of a ""hack"" then a real fix.... If you are distributing the JRE with your Application you could replace the coffee cup icon resource in the java exe/dll/rt.jar wherever that is with your own icon. It might not be very legit but it is a possibility... Agreed. It'd work but I'm not feeling that desperate. :) If it's the only way it doesn't matter if you're desperate or not :) My company does it through InstallAnywhere's `executableIcon` property. I think it does it by replacing `JavaCup.png` in `jre/lib/resources.jar`.  Also if you have one ""main"" window and set its icon properly as long as you use that main window as the ""parent"" for any Dialog classes they will inherit the icon. Any new Frames need to have the icon set on them though. as Paul/Andreas said subclassing JFrame is going to be your best bet.  You can make the root form (by which I assume you mean JFrame) be your own subclass of JFrame and put standard functionality in its constructor such as:  this.setIconImage(STANDARD_ICON); You can bundle other standard stuff in here too such as memorizing the frame's window metrics as a user preference managing splash panes etc. Any new frames spawned by this one would also be instances of this JFrame subclass. The only thing you have to remember is to instantiate your subclass instead of JFrame. I don't think there's any substitute for remembering to do this but at least now it's a matter of remembering a subclass instead of a setIconImage call (among possibly other features). Not ideal but it works. There should be a way of doing this for all forms in an app. Some forms might be spawned by third party tools etc. Yes there *should* be a way but sun hasn't provided one. Its probably a sev3 enhancement in bugparade somewhere...  There may be a way of doing it using the Look and Feel overriding the UIDefaults.

320682,Do I need to free Swing components before letting them get garbage collected? Wnen I use external resources such as files or DB connection I need to close them before I let them go. Do I need to do the same thing with Swing components ? If yes then how ? Objects are automatically garbage collected if there are no references to them. You do not have to treat Swing components the same way that you do external resources. However if you have a component that you are not going to need later you can set any references to that component to null. JPanel p = new JPanel(); p = null; Setting p to null does not delete the object but it removes any references to the object so the next time the garbage collector passes it gets picked up. You will have to be careful though that other reference to the component do not exist. p = null is rarely needed. See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/271530/cross-references-and-garbage-collection But swing components use external resources (eg window handles I gues) what about them ?  Normally you don't need to dispose of objects when you are done with them (although setting the references to them to null may allow them to be GCed sooner). However AWT and Swing objects allocate some amount of native resources that need to be freed. Furthermore the AWT thread treats the windows as top-level objects preventing them from being garbage collected and the JVM from terminating. Thus when you are done with your window you need to dispose of it which frees the native resources that it has allocated. One way to do this is to call Window.dispose() on it. However a better option would be to call JFrame.setDefaultCloseOperation() when you initialize each of your root windows. If you pass it DISPOSE_ON_CLOSE it will take care of disposing itself when the user closes the window. When the last such window closes the AWT thread will stop blocking and allow the JVM to close (assuming you don't have any other aberrant threads running). Alternatively you can pass it EXIT_ON_CLOSE which will cause your window to call System.exit() which tells the JVM that your application is done and to gracefully terminate. An what if I only get rid of a JPanel lith some controls in order to put there someting else ? Withount closing the entire window. What then ?  Windows (including dialogs and frames) should be disposed. If you create (AWT) Graphics objects then they should be disposed of too (but usually locally within say a paintComponent method). If you have a listener to update a short lived target from a long lived source then you should remove it before discarding the target. There's a neat hack where the listener uses a WeakReference to the target so that it can deregister when the reference goes away (and an event is fired).  At one point it was taught that you had to disconnect all the listeners because otherwise they'd act as references to the Swing component. But I'm told that this is no longer a problem.,java swing,3.1270911732166344E-4,0.9861420840917945,0.013153741669129174,3.9146512175455183E-4
187057,"glBlendFunc and alpha blending I want to know how the glBlendFunc works. For example i have 2 gl textures where the alpha is on tex1 i want to have alpha in my final image. Where the color is on tex1 i want the color from tex2 to be. Seconding the shaders. If you can use a shader its much easier to just do what you want with the data rather than messing with arcane blending functions.  glBlendFunc applies only to how the final color fragment gets blended with the frame buffer. I think what you want is multitexturing to combine the two textures by blending the texture stages using glTexEnv or using a fragment shader to combine the the two textures. Does this require use of ARB extension? DavidG: If the technique uses ARB_texture_env_combine or shaders it will. Both are widely supported.  Sadly this is for openGL ES on the iPhone so no shaders but point taken. My problem was a very simplified version of the questions i needed to apply a simple color ( incl alpha ) to a part of a defined texture. As Lee pointed out texture blending is to allow alpha to show up on the framebuffer. The solution was to insist that the artist makes the ""action bit"" of the texture white and then assigning a color to the vertices that i render. Something like this. glTexCoordPointer( 2 GL_FLOAT 0 sprite->GetTexBuffer() ); glVertexPointer( 3 GL_FLOAT 0 sprite->GetVertexBuffer() ); glColorPointer( 4 GL_FLOAT 0 sprite->GetColorBuffer() ); glDrawArrays( GL_TRIANGLES 0 6 ); // Draw 2 triangles Where even tho it has a texture having the color means it adds to the texture's color so where it's an alpha it remains alpha and where it is white ( as i had to make it ) it becomes the color of the color pointer at the point. What does ""action bit"" mean? Does what you describe here solve your problem? yeah that solved my problem. ""action bit"" is the part that i want drawn in a different color. basically if i want a single texture ( maybe like a font set ) where each non transparent bit needs a custom color i used this.  Sorry can't do this with simple blending. We for instance used to do the same thing using frament shaders.",c++ opengl,0.9983210059524885,6.402522567984427E-4,5.472692024148184E-4,4.914725882981789E-4

The key is the sql query which you will set up as a string: $sqlquery = ""SELECT field1 field2 FROM table WHERE NOT columnA = 'x' AND NOT columbB = 'y'""; Note that there are a lot of ways to specify NOT. Another one that works just as well is: $sqlquery = ""SELECT field1 field2 FROM table WHERE columnA != 'x' AND columbB != 'y'""; Here is a full example of how to use it: $link = mysql_connect($dbHost$dbUser$dbPass) or die(""Unable to connect to database""); mysql_select_db(""$dbName"") or die(""Unable to select database $dbName""); $sqlquery = ""SELECT field1 field2 FROM table WHERE NOT columnA = 'x' AND NOT columbB = 'y'""; $result=mysql_query($sqlquery); while ($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($result) { //do stuff } You can do whatever you would like within the above while loop. Access each field of the table as an element of the $row array which means that $row['field1'] will give you the value for field1 on the current row and $row['field2'] will give you the value for field2. Note that if the column(s) could have NULL values those will not be found using either of the above syntaxes.

The first column of ALL tables is called classified_id. If the user searches for ""cars"" then the main table will match everything in table t1 (which is the cars table) where classified_id is the same in both tables. So:  SELECT * FROM main_table t1 WHERE main_table.classified_id=t1.classified_id This works fine although I am not sure this is the way to join here. Performance is an issue in my case! However here is my problem. Whenever ALL CLASSIFIEDS are searched then I need to match the main_table.classified_id to the other tables classified_id column and get every classified there is.

Is that right? then return 0! No matches found! Check my update! If the row would exist in all tables (i.e. every table has a row for a specific classified_id) then you would use an inner join: SELECT m.classified_id m.category t1.year ........

See the infonode docking windows. They have a gpl version and a commercial version but the licenses are not that expensive. Robust and good looking if you select the right skin (we use the ShapedGradientDockingTheme which looks a little like eclipse). Do you know if it is actively developed? The last release is from over a year now... Well the company is still there so I think they are. I haven't seen increases in version numbers for a while though. Not expensive? A commercial Infonode docking license costs $6000! $6000 is for a site license single user is $300.  I've just released another docking framework. It's really lightweight and available under the Apache 2.0 license. Raven Docking: http://raven.java.net/ravenDocking/index.html  We use VLDocking from vlsolutions (http://vldocking.com) quite successfully in 3 of our products. They have some open-source license compatible with GPL.  JIDE has quite a few components including a docking framework. The core of JIDE is open source but they also have several commercial libraries. The docking framework is commercial. http://www.jidesoft.com/products/component.htm  I have successfully used FlexDock in the past but it seems not well supported and it is quite hard to start with (this is a quite complex framework for docking). FlexDock is open source. Besides more recently I have enjoyed using MyDoggy which is well supported and quite easy to use (very well documented with enough examples and tutorials). Its main drawback (for me) is the difficulty to adapt its look when using 3rd-party LAFs (like Substance for instance). But in general I really like it. If I remember correctly it is quite a lightweight library. I would recommend it for any use (it is open source and free to use) for its good API.  I once evaluated several docking frameworks (including the already mentioned flexdock and mydoggy and jdocking. Finaly I came to Docking Frames which I can really recommend. It is easy to use but still feature rich + good documentation and quick support from developer via forum. +1 docking frames is quite nice and its still supported updated just a few weeks ago After reviewing the list above and testing a few of the frameworks I decided to give Docking Frames a shot mainly because it seems like the most active project.,java swing frameworks docking,2.2225702492301613E-4,0.9991896901628464,3.0982020402421466E-4,2.782326082062894E-4

My table name does not have uppercase letters. Is there a way to query my table without including the database name i.e. showfinder.sf_bands? Are you sure that the sf_bands table exists? Does showfinder.sf_bands work? showfinder.sf_bands works perfectly Perhaps I should note that my database was migrated from MySQL Can you try pg_query($dbconn $query)? The implicit connection can cause hard-to-debug issues may as well eliminate it as a possible problem. Can you also try pg_dbname($dbconn) to make sure it's indeed connected to showfinder? Postgres process query different from other RDMS. Put schema name in double quote before your table name like this ""SCHEMA_NAME"".""SF_Bands"" What does your answer adds to the previously accepted answer upvoted 22 times and with lot of details?  From what I've read this error means that you're not referencing the table name correctly. One common reason is that the table is defined with a mixed-case spelling and you're trying to query it with all lower-case. In other words the following fails: CREATE TABLE ""SF_Bands"" ( ... ); SELECT * FROM sf_bands; -- ERROR! Use double-quotes to delimit identifiers so you can use the specific mixed-case spelling as the table is defined. SELECT * FROM ""SF_Bands""; Re your comment you can add a schema to the ""search_path"" so that when you reference a table name without qualifying its schema the query will match that table name by checked each schema in order. Just like PATH in the shell or include_path in PHP etc. You can check your current schema search path: SHOW search_path ""$user""public You can change your schema search path: SET search_path TO showfinderpublic; See also http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/static/ddl-schemas.html Oops forgive me. I meant to say that my table name has no uppercase letters not my database name. That did it many thanks! Right on the money! +1 @romkyns: Yes this is actually pretty common across RDBMS brands that undelimited identifiers are advertised as ""case-insensitive."" But they're not truly case insensitive because the way they've implemented that is to force lowercase. This matches the name of the table only if you had allowed the table name to be lowercased when you defined the table. If you use double-quote delimiters when you CREATE TABLE you must use delimiters when you reference it in queries. It appears that even if you type `SELECT * FROM SF_Bands` this will still fail because Postgres decides to lowercase that table name for you. Weird...  If everything posted above fails try to put dbname parameter in your connection string. It works for me while everything else failed.  pg_query($dbconn $query); make sure the database connection is successful... this is a nonsense if the connection fail the code he posted would stop at `or die('Could not connect: ' . pg_last_error());`  I had problems with this and this is the story (sad but true) : If your table name is all lower case like : accounts you can use: select * from AcCounTs and it will work fine If your table name is all lower case like : accounts The following will fail: select * from ""AcCounTs"" If your table name is mixed case like : Accounts The following will fail: select * from accounts If your table name is mixed case like : Accounts The following will work OK: select * from ""Accounts"" I dont like remembering useless stuff like this but you have to ;) Same for column names in where-clauses 5.

695794,"more efficient way to pickle a string The pickle module seems to use string escape characters when pickling; this becomes inefficient e.g. on numpy arrays. Consider the following z = numpy.zeros(1000 numpy.uint8) len(z.dumps()) len(cPickle.dumps(z.dumps())) The lengths are 1133 characters and 4249 characters respectively. z.dumps() reveals something like ""\x00\x00"" (actual zeros in string) but pickle seems to be using the string's repr() function yielding ""'\x00\x00'"" (zeros being ascii zeros). i.e. (""0"" in z.dumps() == False) and (""0"" in cPickle.dumps(z.dumps()) == True) You should add a specific question to your post here. What do you want to serialize a Python string or a numpy array of bytes? should be len(cPickle.dumps(z)) Try using a later version of the pickle protocol with the protocol parameter to pickle.dumps(). The default is 0 and is an ASCII text format. Ones greater than 1 (I suggest you use pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL). Protocol formats 1 and 2 (and 3 but that's for py3k) are binary and should be more space conservative.  Solution: import zlib cPickle def zdumps(obj): return zlib.compress(cPickle.dumps(objcPickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL)9) def zloads(zstr): return cPickle.loads(zlib.decompress(zstr)) >>> len(zdumps(z)) 128 Here's something more on the subject: http://tinyurl.com/3ymhaj5 .

At present the tables simply remain their current size and do not scale. I'm sure its something simple but I'm having trouble locating the exact approach needed. Many thanks in advance. I will provide any more information if required. edit: The JDialog is used as a wizard so only one of the panels is being displayed at any one time hence the use of CardLayout. I would ideally like to keep this is layout manager although if it is the source of the problems then obviously I would rethink! You can keep the CardLayout but you need to do the following: 1. set the layout of your JDialog to BorderLayout and add a new JPanel (contentPanel) to the JDialog 2. now set this contentPanel layout to be CardLayout 3. add your other panels to the cardlayout as required. 4. Also make sure off the layouts you use on each of the panels you're adding to the CardLayout. By default JPanel uses FlowLayout I think and this is not ideal for a JTable. So you might need to play around with the layout of the panel containing the table as well; try out BoxLayout or BorderLayout for that as well.,java swing resize jdialog,7.535528992364692E-4,0.9666057939101862,0.03169731747982255,9.433357107546799E-4
23918,"OpenGL Rotation I'm trying to do a simple rotation in OpenGL but must be missing the point. I'm not looking for a specific fix so much as a quick explanation or link that explains OpenGL rotation more generally. At the moment I have code like this: glPushMatrix(); glRotatef(90.0 0.0 1.0 0.0); glBegin(GL_TRIANGLES); glVertex3f( 1.0 1.0 0.0 ); glVertex3f( 3.0 2.0 0.0 ); glVertex3f( 3.0 1.0 0.0 ); glEnd(); glPopMatrix(); But the result is not a triangle rotated 90 degrees. Edit Hmm thanks to Mike Haboustak - it appeared my code was calling a SetCamera function that use glOrtho. I'm too new to OpenGL to have any idea of what this meant but disabling this and rotating in the Z-axis produced the desired result. Thanks! The ""accepted answer"" is not fully correct - rotating around the Z will not help you see this triangle unless you've done some strange things prior to this code. Removing a glOrtho(...) call might have corrected the problem in this case but you still have a couple of other issues. Two major problems with the code as written: Have you positioned the camera previously? In OpenGL the camera is located at the origin looking down the Z axis with positive Y as up. In this case the triangle is being drawn in the same plane as your eye but up and to the right. Unless you have a very strange projection matrix you won't see it. gluLookat() is the easiest command to do this but any command that moves the current matrix (which should be MODELVIEW) can be made to work. You are drawing the triangle in a left handed or clockwise method whereas the default for OpenGL is a right handed or counterclockwise coordinate system. This means that if you are culling backfaces (which you are probably not but will likely move onto as you get more advanced) you would not see the triangle as expected. To see the problem put your right hand in front of your face and imagining it is in the X-Y plane move your fingers in the order you draw the vertices (11) to (32) to (31). When you do this your thumb is facing away from your face meaning you are looking at the back side of the triangle. You need to get into the habit of drawing faces in a right handed method since that is the common way it is done in OpenGL. The best thing I can recommend is to use the NeHe tutorials - http://nehe.gamedev.net/. They begin by showing you how to set up OpenGL in several systems move onto drawing triangles and continue slowly and surely to more advanced topics. They are very easy to follow.  Regarding Projection matrix you can find a good source to start with here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb147302(VS.85).aspx It explains a bit about how to construct one type of projection matrix. Orthographic projection is the very basic/primitive form of such a matrix and basically what is does is taking 2 of the 3 axes coordinates and project them to the screen (you can still flip axes and scale them but there is no warp or perspective effect). transformation of matrices is most likely one of the most important things when rendering in 3D and basically involves 3 matrix stages: Transform1 = Object coordinates system to World (for example - object rotation and scale) Transform2 = World coordinates system to Camera (placing the object in the right place) Transform3 = Camera coordinates system to Screen space (projecting to screen) Usually the 3 matrix multiplication result is referred to as the WorldViewProjection matrix (if you ever bump into this term) since it transforms the coordinates from Model space through World then to Camera and finally to the screen representation. Have fun  When I had a first look at OpenGL the NeHe tutorials (see the left menu) were invaluable.  Ensure that you're modifying the modelview matrix by putting the following before the glRotatef call: glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW); Otherwise you may be modifying either the projection or a texture matrix instead.  Do you get a 1 unit straight line? It seems that 90deg rot. around Y is going to have you looking at the side of a triangle with no depth. You should try rotating around the Z axis instead and see if you get something that makes more sense. OpenGL has two matrices related to the display of geometry the ModelView and the Projection. Both are applied to coordinates before the data becomes visible on the screen. First the ModelView matrix is applied transforming the data from model space into view space. Then the Projection matrix is applied with transforms the data from view space for ""projection"" on your 2D monitor. ModelView is used to position multiple objects to their locations in the ""world"" Projection is used to position the objects onto the screen. Your code seems fine so I assume from reading the documentation you know what the nature of functions like glPushMatrix() is. If rotating around Z still doesn't make sense verify that you're editing the ModelView matrix by calling glMatrixMode. IMPORTANT! See also Perry's answer below.  I'd like to recommend a book: 3D Computer Graphics : A Mathematical Introduction with OpenGL by Samuel R. Buss It provides very clear explanations and the mathematics are widely applicable to non-graphics domains.

So instead of this for finding one ad and displaying it: SELECT category_option.option_name option_values.value FROM classified category_option option_values WHERE classified.classified_id=?id AND classified.cat_id=category_options.cat_id AND option_values.option_id=category_options.option_id I could use this: SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE classified_id = $classified_id Isn't the last one actually faster? Or does a normalized db permform faster? Thanks The query using a JOIN is trivial as far as MySQL joins are concerned. I see no need to denormalize this. I would however suggest rewriting it to not be such a PITA to read: SELECT category_option.option_name option_values.value FROM classified JOIN category_option USING (cat_id) JOIN option_values USING (option_id) WHERE classified.classified_id = ?  Whenever you do denormalization you usually gain reading speed and lose write speed because you have to write the same value many times. Additionally extra care should be taken to maintain data integrity. How many times the query will be executed? Is this a high traffic application? Can you add a cache? What I meant suggesting to add a cache is to consider other alternatives of performance improvement. I have to add a cache yes but what does that have to do with normalization? Because the results are cached not the database am I right? It is pretty heavy traffic also and what do you mean how many times will the query be executed? Only once every time users click 'search' i guess... sorry But you have to explain a little more detailed  I would advise against denormalizing in your situation. You'll get better with joins as you use them more and they start to become clearer in your head and maintenance ease is a good benefit for the future. Here's a pretty good link about normalization (and denormalization). Here's a question about denormalization. One answer suggests creating a view using joins to get the data you need and using that like your SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE classified_id = $classified_id query. A normalized DB will likely be slower but it's unlikely you'll want to denormalize for that reason.

458817,"Java Swing: Libraries Tools Layout Managers What libraries/tools do you have in your Java Swing Tool set? XUL Layout Managers Packagers/Installers Books etc..... Two useful Swing related libraries: The Swing Application Framework is a light framework that simplifies the creation and maintaining of small- to medium-sized Java desktop applications. The framework consists of a Java class library that supports constructs for things such as the following: Remembering state between sessions. Easier managing of actions including running as background tasks and specifying blocking behavior. Enhanced resource management including resource injection for bean properties. Here's an article about it. It's been integrated with Netbeans 6.0 and later. EventBus is a Swing-oriented publisher-subscriber framework that I've found very useful for updating GUIs.  Not really a tool but I've been working on annotating important things in the JavaDocs for Swing (and several other APIs). Too many methods contain surprises like ""don't call this if you want a refresh call X instead"". I use a tool that I built for my PhD to access that kind of info (it highlights calls in the source code to methods that have those sort of things). IMHO the JavaDocs for swing are difficult to use because they combine information that is meant for people using an object and people subclassing existing classes. Sounds interesting. Anything that you are going to make available to the rest of us? Right now it only supports Eclipse. I've still got to do some cleanups and update the annotations database before I am presenting it at Eclipsecon at the end of March but if you want to try it out visit http://emoose.cs.cmu.edu or contact me and I'll gladly help you with the install.  Here is what I use: ""Framework"": Swing Application Framework does not do much but does it quite well (if you use it you may want to take a look at one presentation I did last year) JTables: handling tables is often a pain (lots of boilerplate code...); I generally use GlazedLists which simplifies the work a lot (and brings many improvements) EventBus: this was mentioned in another answer LayoutManager: DesignGridLayout (shameless plug this is one of my open source projects) Look & Feel: Substance is very good in some situations where you don't want to use the system look and feel Docking library: if your application needs docking you will find MyDoggy useful (and it has a well-written API). One problem it has is a bad integration with some third-party look and feels (like Substance) All these libraries above are open source. In addition to that I have my own set of utility classes that among other things help integrating the GUI with a Dependency Injection library: I have a set of utilities for HiveMind container (for the few developers that know it and still use it) and another -in preparation soon open sourced- for Guice. I have read no specific book about Swing development but I have used Swing for about 10 years now (not continuously however). Hence I have no recommendation in terms of books (unfortunately because I admit that this is one weak point of Swing). ""Filthy Rich Clients"" book is useful only if: you know Swing well you want to build ""fancy"" GUIs  For books take a look at the answers to Swing Programming Books.  Netbeans with the GUI WYSIWYG editor. It makes creating Java 6 Swing forms very easy. I subclass the forms to add functionality to ensure continued tool support. I've also used SwingX for widgets like date pickers and collapsible panels. Plus there's always SwingWorker in the JRE for running background jobs that update the UI.  I pretty much only use GridBagLayout for production code unless the GUI is so simple that I can get away with a BorderLayout. I sometimes look into other LayoutManagers but never really found the need to change since GridBagLayout can do pretty much anything I need. The installer I use for my own stuff is izPack and works for me so far. It has been a long time since I really read any Swing books now. Obviously the Java Swing one from O'Reilly is the de facto bible :) When it comes to books on design I do have a lot of recommendations but that might be off topic? Totally Gridbag - http://madbean.com/anim/totallygridbag/ @Ran Biron that is the best comment I have seen on SO thus far. That is so reminiscent of my GridBagLayout experiences. At one point I even wrote a GridBagLayout wrapper for most of the stuff I do but it's hard to really grok. +1 for this answer so more people see this comment :)  Spring Rich Client and JGoodies are the base of my team's GUI applications; Spring remoting for connecting to server and Java Web Start for deployement.",java swing devtools,1.9417426720116078E-4,0.9203216865647836,0.06344698430518712,0.016037154862828047

Let's say I am currently on videoId: 234 so Next and Previous video links will point to videoId: 233 and 235 respecively. My table structure is as follows: videoId videoName videoURL IsActive ----------------------------------------------------- 1 Love world love-world 1 2 Hello world hellow-world 1 3 World news world-news 0 4 The web the-web 1 5 Google web google-web 1 6 Internet internet 1 IsActive a bool (01) type column is basically tells that video is viewable on website or not. If its 0 - notviewable and 1 - viewable Now there are two type of situations which I though are: When I am browsing through videoId: 4 then I want to run a query to get the the next and previous video id means 2 and 5 respectively 3 is not because it is disabled. Other condition would be When I am browsing through videoId: 1 then query should return only one record which is 2 because there is no previous record same in the case of last record. Please tell me how to make query for this? Thanks MAking a bunch of assumptions here but Consider what will happen if: A user views the ""Hello World"" video An admin(or who ever) marks ""The Web"" as inactive. that user clicks next. best query string : SELECT (SELECT MAX(`id`) FROM `table` WHERE `id` < `t`.`id`) as `_prev_id` (SELECT MIN(`id`) FROM `table` WHERE `id` > `t`.`id`) as `_next_id` FROM `table` `t` WHERE `t`.`id` = '1' LIMIT 1  I'd use  SELECT * FROM videos WHERE videoId > :id AND IsActive = 1 LIMIT 1 UNION SELECT * FROM videos WHERE videoId < :id AND IsActive = 1 LIMIT 1  Try this. Completely untested but this will give you a normal row with two additional columns 'nextID' and 'prevID'. If one of them is null then there isn't one. SELECT v.* n.id AS nextID p.id AS prevID FROM vedios v LEFT JOIN (SELECT vn.id FROM vedios vn WHERE vn.id > v.id AND isActive = 1 ORDER BY id ASC LIMIT 1) n LEFT JOIN (SELECT vp.id FROM vedios vp WHERE vp.id < v.id AND isActive = 1 ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1) p If you have any issues / errors with it let me know and I'll test it properly.  This will get the next one $stmt = $PDO->prepare(""SELECT * FROM vedios WHERE vedio > :id AND IsActive = 1"") $stmt->execute(array(""id"" => $id)); $all = $stmt->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC); And change > to < for previous. If count($all) return 0 then you don't have a next/previous video. Ok but is it possible to fetch both next and previous in two rows using a single query?  I think you could use something like: SELECT * FROM videos AS c WHERE (VideoId = (SELECT MAX(VideoId) FROM videos WHERE VideoId < c.VideoId AND IsActive = 1) OR VideoId = (SELECT MIN(VideoId) FROM videos WHERE VideoId > c.VideoId AND IsActive = 1))",php sql database mysql,2.822025715715843E-4,4.602198164995873E-4,0.9989043021302737,3.5327548165499145E-4
205522,openGL SubTexturing I have image data and i want to get a sub image of that to use as an opengl texture. glGenTextures(1 &m_name); glGetIntegerv(GL_TEXTURE_BINDING_2D &oldName); glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D m_name); glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER GL_LINEAR); glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER GL_LINEAR); glTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D 0 GL_RGBA m_width m_height 0 GL_RGBA GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE m_data); How can i get a sub image of that image loaded as a texture. I think it has something to do with using glTexSubImage2D but i have no clue how to use it to create a new texture that i can load. Calling: glTexSubImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D 0 xOffset yOffset xWidth yHeight GL_RGBA GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE m_data); doe nothing that i can see and calling glCopyTexSubImage2D just takes part of my framebuffer. Thanks Edit: Use glPixelStorei. You use it to set GL_UNPACK_ROW_LENGTH to the width (in pixels) of the entire image. Then you call glTexImage2D (or whatever) passing it a pointer to the first pixel of the subimage and the width and height of the subimage. Don't forget to restore GL_UNPACK_ROW_LENGTH to 0 when you're finished with it. Ie: glPixelStorei( GL_UNPACK_ROW_LENGTH img_width ); char *subimg = (char*)m_data + (sub_x + sub_y*img_width)*4; glTexImage2D( GL_TEXTURE_2D 0 GL_RGBA sub_width sub_height 0 GL_RGBA GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE subimg ); glPixelStorei( GL_UNPACK_ROW_LENGTH 0 ); Or if you're allergic to pointer maths: glPixelStorei( GL_UNPACK_ROW_LENGTH img_width ); glPixelStorei( GL_UNPACK_SKIP_PIXELS sub_x ); glPixelStorei( GL_UNPACK_SKIP_ROWS sub_y ); glTexImage2D( GL_TEXTURE_2D 0 GL_RGBA sub_width sub_height 0 GL_RGBA GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE m_data ); glPixelStorei( GL_UNPACK_ROW_LENGTH 0 ); glPixelStorei( GL_UNPACK_SKIP_PIXELS 0 ); glPixelStorei( GL_UNPACK_SKIP_ROWS 0 ); Edit2: For the sake of completeness I should point out that if you're using OpenGL-ES then you don't get GL_UNPACK_ROW_LENGTH. In which case you could either (a) extract the subimage into a new buffer yourself or (b)... glTexImage2D( GL_TEXTURE_2D 0 GL_RGBA sub_width sub_height 0 GL_RGBA GL_UNSIGNED_BYTES NULL ); for( int y = 0; y < sub_height; y++ ) { char *row = m_data + ((y + sub_y)*img_width + sub_x) * 4; glTexSubImage2D( GL_TEXTURE_2D 0 0 y sub_width 1 GL_RGBA GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE row ); } Basically i have an image ( as raw data ) and i want to use part of that image as a texture. I know how to load the entire image as a texture but don't know how to use just a bit of it. Poster answered this. If you have an image in memory it is stored somehow. If you used glTexImage2D(...GL_RGBA GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE) to load then there's a byte for R G B and alpha value. The images are stored with pixel (0 0) starts at position 0. Pixel x at row y starts at image[width*y+x][0] since i am using openGL ES i ended up doing the first option u gave that is extracting subimage into a new buffer. sadly on the device it no longer works so i'm going to rework the texture so that i don't need to solve the problem.,c++ opengl,0.9935710547438024,4.259953662264357E-4,3.6412857874633424E-4,0.005638821311224794
210214,"Learning Java Swing? I am a veteran C/C++ programmer who has used Win32 MFC and WTL to write Windows apps for many years. I have some very basic Java experience but haven't done anything with a UI. I want to start learning how to write desktop apps in Java and from what I can gather Swing is the way to go. My question is: where do I start? Can anyone recommend any decent books? (I do like a good programming book). I've played with Netbeans a little in the past (and was impressed with what I saw) so I'd like to use that as my Java IDE of choice if that makes any difference. You should definitely see the SwingSet2 demo which comes with jdk. You can see the sources there and it is a great reference as an ""how-to"" about Swing objects. If I start to use a new Swing object in my application I just check those sources to see my options.  Once you get your feet wet I highly recommend the book ""Swing Hacks"" to harness the full power of swing.  I also like the O'Reilly Java Swing book; it's been useful to me. Good descriptions of concepts good references clear concise and to the point. That would be my recommendation. It's the first book I get when searching amazon for ""java swing"". Also amusingly that search will get you a porch swing made from wood from the island of Java...  That's exactly how I came to Java/Swing from C++/MFC etc. I have to agree that Swing is the only way to go there's a lot to learn in terms of concepts but if you know MFC inside out it will help (because the fundamentals aren't that different they're both event driven windowing systems except one of them is a bag of spanners held together with string)... I started with a copy of an IDE (Jbuilder in my case) and worked through the Sun Java Swing Tutorials Also this beginner's guide is pretty useful for the big picture.  This question and this question is very similar to yours. There are a ton of good answers here too.  The Swing Tutorial is very nice. That's how I taught myself swing.  Netbeans is a decent environment. Check out the O'Reilly Java Swing (Marmoset on cover) for a pretty good look at the ins and outs. However My edition is 2001 and I don't know if the more current ones are any good or not. The big gotcha in Swing is: Don't do any significant work in the listeners. And don't access swing components from any thread other than the EDT (SwingUtilities.invoke* and SwingWorker are your friends) +1 jsight. Even seemingly ""safe"" calls such as ""setVisible()"" on a top-level frame are not necessarily safe from outside the EDT.  If your intention is to use NetBeans and its powerful GUI building capabilities I'd recommend trying to do a lot of hand coding to start with. When I conduct interview we get a lot of people who might be able to use a GUI builder but that is not quite the same thing as 'knowing' Swing.  If you really want a good book and not an eBook or a pdf Java : The complete reference by Herbert Schildt is the best. It is like an encyclopedia and explains a lot of concepts including swing clearly.  You can start to learn it by doing simple apps using Netbeans GUI editor which gives you a quick view on your app. Meanwhile Swing is very flexible and powerful. Since you can do almost anything in Swing this advantage leads to somehow deeper learning curve. To learn more you need some good book (like java swing or sun's swing tutorial on their web) and good understanding of MVC design pattern Java bean style event handling customerized rendered etc. Anyway Swing is of much better OOP and MVC than the old age mixed MFC library. You should be able to learn a bit on how to design a clean a extensible app through the learning of Swing.  I wrote a site as part of a project whilst at University that taught students how to learn Swing through example and exercises (with a bunch of screenshots). Although I don't have personal access to it any longer Heriot Watt University still host it. You can find the link here.. The Guidebook - Lessons in Swing Might get you started at least :)  Once you have mastered the basics the de-facto standard book for top notch swing GUIs is Filthy Rich Clients. I think your link is not what you think. Corrected thanks for the heads up.  I'm sorry but what I'd recommend is to stay clear of Swing altogether X-) From my point of view it's veeery verbose (even for Java) but more than anything it has a confusing and unintuitive API (repaint()/refresh() comes to mind) that will haunt you with subtle bugs every day. I'd try SWT instead.. Clearer better looking and has better performance too. What are your credentials? How big applications have you build in Swing and SWT? Are you talking about the core APIs or about certain RCP layers on top of them? Hi :) I've been a Java dev for 3yrs my team was to build a rich client designed to manage small-to-mid retail stores at every level. Eventually we dropped it and went for a web UI instead (management decision). I knew my answer would be downvoted I just had to share the pain Swing did to us :D  Just another book recommendation: Java Swing by Matthew Robinson und Pavel Vorobiev It's the only book i read on Swing so far so i can't compare it to the other ones.

416947,"Swing components are light-weight? Whenever I read about Swing they say they are light weight components. So I just googled Swing and found that it means Swing does not depend on native peers. Is that why they are called ""light weight""? I mean by light weight I thought maybe the Swing components occupy less memory than the AWT components. Isn't that so? Lightweight vs heavyweight is a question of how the UI components are implemented. Heavyweight components wrap operating system objects lightweight components don't. They are implemented strictly in the JDK. what can you say about the memory the components occupy pal ? do the swing components occupy less memory ? It's hard to say. Lightweight components may occupy more simply because the operating system handles some of the stuff with heavyweight components. Or the overhead of OS objects might be huge. Or simply interfacing those objects might have a huge overhead. In addition to this it highly depends on the LAF (Look & Feel) you use. This is one other advantage of Swing: you can change LAF in just a few lines of code.  Swing is considered lightweight because it is fully implemented in Java without calling the native operating system for drawing the graphical user interface components. On the other hand AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) is heavyweight toolkit as it merely makes calls to the operating system in order to produce its GUI components. The Evolution of the Swing Paint System section from the Painting in AWT and Swing article explains the difference between lightweight and heavyweight: When the original AWT API was developed for JDK 1.0 only heavyweight components existed (""heavyweight"" means that the component has it's own opaque native window). This allowed the AWT to rely heavily on the paint subsystem in each native platform. [...] With the introduction of lightweight components in JDK 1.1 (a ""lightweight"" component is one that reuses the native window of its closest heavyweight ancestor) the AWT needed to implement the paint processing for lightweight components in the shared Java code. As Swing is implemented in Java it does have some performance disadvantage however I hear that performance has improved in recent releases of Java. The advantage of Swing is that it has many more components available such as JTable and JList which are more graphical and extensible than the components provided in AWT allowing for more graphics-rich applications to be developed. i agree that there are too many cool things with swing - especially the tooltips and icons . In Java 6 the Windows look-and-feel delegates to the OS to draw the lightweight components (see http://weblogs.java.net/blog/chet/archive/2006/02/these_are_some.html).",java swing awt,2.9401307059578424E-4,0.9989280803005529,4.0984616593929145E-4,3.680604629119807E-4

I'm programing this in Java 1.3.1 and swing. Java 1.3.1? As in only supported on vintage Solaris 8 and no bugs from April? Yeah I know. The desktop machines that I'm developing this for have older applications that still run on this version and I don't want to mess with that. I suggest going straight for the model approach in Swing. After you've put the component in the panel and layout manager don't even bother keeping a specific reference to it. If you really want the widget then you can test each with isSelected or maintain a Map<ButtonModelJRadioButton>.  I got similar problem and solved with this: import java.util.Enumeration; import javax.swing.AbstractButton; import javax.swing.ButtonGroup; public class GroupButtonUtils { public String getSelectedButtonText(ButtonGroup buttonGroup) { for (Enumeration<AbstractButton> buttons = buttonGroup.getElements(); buttons.hasMoreElements();) { AbstractButton button = buttons.nextElement(); if (button.isSelected()) { return button.getText(); } } return null; } } It returns the text of the selected button. I love making custom methods for tasks. Nicely done. This method is EXACTLY what I needed. I thank you very much! I wish I could give you 999 ups. This should probably be in Java in the first place...  I would just loop through your JRadioButtons and call isSelected(). If you really want to go from the ButtonGroup you can only get to the models. You could match the models to the buttons but then if you have access to the buttons why not use them directly? It does look like this is the only way thanks. please consider this reading : http://www.javaworld.com/article/2077509/core-java/java-tip-142--pushing-jbuttongroup.html what could possibly be the point of button group then? @Thufir : ButtonGroup tells Java that only on of the JRadioButtons of the group should be selected. without that all of them could be selected simultaneously.  Use the isSelected() method. It will tell you the state of your radioButton. Using it in combination with a loop(say for loop) you can find which one has been selected. Isn't this the same as the accepted answer?  The following code displays which JRadiobutton is selected from Buttongroup on click of a button. It is done by looping through all JRadioButtons in a particular buttonGroup.  JRadioButton firstRadioButton=new JRadioButton(""Female""true); JRadioButton secondRadioButton=new JRadioButton(""Male""); //Create a radio button group using ButtonGroup ButtonGroup btngroup=new ButtonGroup(); btngroup.add(firstRadioButton); btngroup.add(secondRadioButton); //Create a button with text ( What i select ) JButton button=new JButton(""What i select""); //Add action listener to created button button.addActionListener(this); //Get selected JRadioButton from ButtonGroup public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent event) { if(event.getSource()==button) { Enumeration<AbstractButton> allRadioButton=btngroup.getElements(); while(allRadioButton.hasMoreElements()) { JRadioButton temp=(JRadioButton)allRadioButton.nextElement(); if(temp.isSelected()) { JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null""You select : ""+temp.getText()); } } } } hmm ... this differs from earlier answers in that .. ?  You could use getSelectedObjects() of ItemSelectable (superinterface of ButtonModel) which returns the list of selected items. In case of a radio button group it can only be one or none at all. I tried this but I was getting a NPE. I did a little research and found this: http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/DefaultButtonModel.html#getSelectedObjects() Since JRadioButton's button model is JToggleButton.ToggleButtonModel it will always return null.  import javax.swing.Action; import javax.swing.ButtonGroup; import javax.swing.Icon; import javax.swing.JRadioButton; import javax.swing.JToggleButton; public class RadioButton extends JRadioButton { public class RadioButtonModel extends JToggleButton.ToggleButtonModel { public Object[] getSelectedObjects() { if ( isSelected() ) { return new Object[] { RadioButton.this }; } else { return new Object[0]; } } public RadioButton getButton() { return RadioButton.this; } } public RadioButton() { super(); setModel(new RadioButtonModel()); } public RadioButton(Action action) { super(action); setModel(new RadioButtonModel()); } public RadioButton(Icon icon) { super(icon); setModel(new RadioButtonModel()); } public RadioButton(String text) { super(text); setModel(new RadioButtonModel()); } public RadioButton(Icon icon boolean selected) { super(icon selected); setModel(new RadioButtonModel()); } public RadioButton(String text boolean selected) { super(text selected); setModel(new RadioButtonModel()); } public RadioButton(String text Icon icon) { super(text icon); setModel(new RadioButtonModel()); } public RadioButton(String text Icon icon boolean selected) { super(text icon selected); setModel(new RadioButtonModel()); } public static void main(String[] args) { RadioButton b1 = new RadioButton(""A""); RadioButton b2 = new RadioButton(""B""); ButtonGroup group = new ButtonGroup(); group.add(b1); group.add(b2); b2.setSelected(true); RadioButtonModel model = (RadioButtonModel)group.getSelection(); System.out.println(model.getButton().getText()); } }  Add the radiobuttons to a button group then: buttonGroup.getSelection().getActionCommand not answering the question (which was to get the selected _JRadioButton_ vs. its actionCommand)  you must add setActionCommand to the JRadioButton then just do String entree = entreeGroup.getSelection().getActionCommand(); ex  java = new JRadioButton(""Java""); java.setActionCommand(""Java""); c = new JRadioButton(""C/C++""); c.setActionCommand(""c""); System.out.println(""Selected Radio Button: "" + buttonGroup.getSelection().getActionCommand());  jRadioOne = new javax.swing.JRadioButton(); jRadioTwo = new javax.swing.JRadioButton(); jRadioThree = new javax.swing.JRadioButton(); ... then for every button: buttonGroup1.add(jRadioOne); jRadioOne.setText(""One""); jRadioOne.setActionCommand(ONE); jRadioOne.addActionListener(radioButtonActionListener); ...listener ActionListener radioButtonActionListener = new java.awt.event.ActionListener() { public void actionPerformed(java.awt.event.ActionEvent evt) { radioButtonActionPerformed(evt); } }; ...do whatever you need as response to event protected void radioButtonActionPerformed(ActionEvent evt) { System.out.println(evt.getActionCommand()); } That confuses input events and state changes.

I'm using Mac OS X 10.6.1 Snow Leopard. numpy.version.version +1 - That looks like a better way of doing it than mine. @Dominic Rodger: yeah but your is more general to any module that cares to set a `__version__`. This is not the public API numpy.__version__ is. Actually `import numpy ; numpy.version.version` . The lack of `import numpy` through me an obvious newbie. Since the use of `__version__` in recommended in PEP8 and most packages support `__version__` vs the non standard `version.version` I think that this answer should be treated more as a curiosity than an accepted method. Use `numpy.__version__` or `.__version__` as [Dominic Rodger's answer recommends](http://stackoverflow.com/a/1520264/298607) Parse the version (and create your own version strings) as recommended in PEP 386 / PEP 440.  You can also check if your version is using MKL with: import numpy numpy.show_config()  from the command line you can simply issue: python -c ""import numpy; print numpy.version.version"" or python -c ""import numpy; print numpy.__version__""  numpy.version.version type it.

1888870,numpy : How to convert an array type quickly I find the astype() method of numpy arrays not very efficient. I have an array containing 3 million of Uint8 point. Multiplying it by a 3x3 matrix takes 2 second but converting the result from uint16 to uint8 takes another second. More precisely :  print time.clock() imgarray = np.dot(imgarray M)/255 print time.clock() imgarray = imgarray.clip(0 255) print time.clock() imgarray = imgarray.astype('B') print time.clock() dot product and scaling takes 2 sec clipping takes 200 msec type conversion takes 1 sec Given the time taken by the other operations I would expect astype to be faster. Is there a faster way to do type conversion or am I wrong when guesstimating that type conversion should not be that hard ? Edit : the goal is to save the final 8 bit array to a file Why do you need to go to uint16 and back again? Is it possible to have `M` as a uint8 matrix then you don't need the conversion. the result of the dot product will exceed the uint8 range. I originally was using a float M matrix and thought going to integer would give me some improvement but this is not true. What takes all that time probably is accessing all the memory locations. Sounds hard to fix. But clipping is also accessing all memory locations yet it is fast. Hopefully clipping does not need to modify a lot of locations. Similar operation done in C don't have this memory bandwith problem so I don't buy the memory acessing problem Interesting here it takes 0.2s 0.02s and 0.01s respectively for those three operations. Sure my machine seems to be faster than yours but the astype() operation certainly doesn't take anywhere near as long as the multiplication. When you use imgarray = imgarray.astype('B') you get a copy of the array cast to the specified type. This requires extra memory allocation even though you immediately flip imgarray to point to the newly allocated array. If you use imgarray.view('uint8') then you get a view of the array. This uses the same data except that it is interpreted as uint8 instead of imgarray.dtype. (np.dot returns a uint32 array so after the np.dot imgarray is of type uint32.) The problem with using view however is that a 32-bit integer becomes viewed as 4 8-bit integers and we only care about the value in the last 8-bits. So we need to skip to every 4th 8-bit integer. We can do that with slicing: imgarray.view('uint8')[:::4] IPython's %timeit command shows there is a significant speed up doing things this way: In [37]: %timeit imgarray2 = imgarray.astype('B') 10000 loops best of 3: 107 us per loop In [39]: %timeit imgarray3 = imgarray.view('B')[:::4] 100000 loops best of 3: 3.64 us per loop Can I save this view to a file @shodanex: Yes you could use np.save().

2104063,"My final mysql db could someone check if the tables are correctly made? I have these tables: category table: cat_id (PK) cat_name category_options table: option_id (PK) cat_id (FK) option_name option_values table: value_id (PK) option_id (FK) value classifieds table: ad_id (PK) (VARCHAR) something like ""Bmw330ci_28238239832"" poster_id (FK) cat_id (FK) headline description price etc.... posters table: poster_id (PK) name email tel password etc.... Three main questions: 1- Is the above good enough? It covers all my needs atleast... 2- Sometimes when I try out different queries I get strange results... Could you write a PHP query string which will fetch one complete ad from an ad_id only? (imagine the only variable you have is ad_id) 3- In the query string must I specify all different tables which are connected in order to display an ad? Can't I just use something like ""SELECT * FROM classifieds WHERE ad_id=$ad_id"" and it would handle the links automatically ie fetch all related information also? Thanks and if you need more input let me know! I'd change ad_id to an int/bigint value if at all possible and store your VARCHAR in a new column. ok I will do that... get rid of the varchar PK in classifieds like @davek suggests and make posters use a int id PK (poster_id) similar to what you did in the other tables and make name a data column so you join on the int but display the name. nice if you need to change a name like what happens after a wedding/divorce oh I missed that actually I DO have a poster_id field! Thanks! I think you should learn how to use SQL so that you know how to make proper queries: http://www.w3schools.com/SQL/sql_intro.asp and http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/select.html to get a complete ad (can return multiple rows): SELECT * FROM classifieds c INNER JOIN posters p ON c.poster_id=p.poster_id INNER JOIN category a ON c.cat_id=a.cat_id INNER JOIN category_options o ON a.cat_id=o.cat_id INNER JOIN option_values v ON o.option_id=v.option_id WHERE ad_id=x You have serious design problems. Never ever ever use name as a PK; it is not unique and it is subject to change! Women change thier names when they get married for instance. In fact don't use any varchars as PKS at all. Use surrogate keys instead. Surrogate keys don't change text keys values often do and they are slower too. And never store name as just one field this is a poor practice. At a minumum you need first name last name middle name and suffix. You wil also need a autoincrementing id field so that John Smith at one address in Chicago can exist in the table with a different John Smith who lives elsewhere in Chicago. No you can't get all the data from related tables without adding them to the query through the use of a join. This is database 101 and if you don't know that then you don't understand relational databases enough to design one. Do some research into joins and querying. You can get all the information for an ad from just having the ad id though as your current relations appear to work. Do not use implied joins when you add the other tables to your queries. They are outdated by 18 years. Learn correctly by using explicit joins. re. ""women change their names when they get married""...make sure your validator allows hyphens.  1) If it meets your needs then wouldn't that make it ""good enough""? But seriously I would agree with davek that you should make the ad_id field an int/bigint and I'd also suggest the same for the posters table. Make the name a regular value field and create an autonum int/bigint PK field for it. If for any reason that user wants to change their name (for privacy concerns perhaps) then you would have to update any foreign keys in the database as well. With an autonum key you wouldn't have this problem. 2) Yes from what I see you should be able to gather all the data on an ad by knowing only the ad_id. 3) No you need to do more than that either equi-join in a SELECT query or use the JOIN keyword to pull your data in.

339821,"Find composite location on screen I am implementing a on screen keyboard in Java for SWT and AWT. One important thing is to move the keyboard to a position where the selected text field can show and is not lying behind the on screen keyboard.

I get the current selected widget by adding a focuslistener to the SWT event queue.

149153,"Loading animated gif from JAR file into ImageIcon I'm trying to create a ImageIcon from a animated gif stored in a jar file. ImageIcon imageIcon = new ImageIcon(ImageIO.read(MyClass.class.getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream(""animated.gif""))); The image loads but only the first frame of the animated gif. The animation does not play. If I load the animated gif from a file on the filesystem everything works as expected. The animation plays through all the of frames. So this works: ImageIcon imageIcon = new ImageIcon(""/path/on/filesystem/animated.gif""); How can I load an animated gif into an ImageIcon from a jar file? EDIT: Here is a complete test case why doesn't this display the animation? import javax.imageio.ImageIO; import javax.swing.*; public class AnimationTest extends JFrame { public static void main(String[] args) { SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable() { public void run() { AnimationTest test = new AnimationTest(); test.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE); test.setVisible(true); } }); } public AnimationTest() { super(); try { JLabel label = new JLabel(); ImageIcon imageIcon = new ImageIcon(ImageIO.read(AnimationTest.class.getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream(""animated.gif""))); label.setIcon(imageIcon); imageIcon.setImageObserver(label); add(label); pack(); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } } You have to use getClass().getResource(imgName); to get a URL to the image file. Check out this tutorial from Real's HowTo. EDIT: Once the image is loaded you have to set the ImageObserver property to get the animation to run. I load png images just fine from the jar file using the first section of code. And the gif loads - it's just not animated. I see your problem now. See my edit for more details. setting the ImageObserver did not help in my case. It seems that ImageIO isn't reading the animated gif properly. If I use a different constructor for the ImageIcon it works. I updated the question with a complete code example. You'll need an animated.gif in your classpath.  Since this thread was just linked from a more current thread that had little to do with animated GIFs but got dragged OT I thought I'd add this trivial source that 'works for me'. import javax.swing.*; import java.net.URL; class AnimatedGifInLabel { public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception { final URL url = new URL(""http://i.stack.imgur.com/OtTIY.gif""); Runnable r = new Runnable() { public void run() { ImageIcon ii = new ImageIcon(url); JLabel label = new JLabel(ii); JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null label); } }; SwingUtilities.invokeLater(r); } } if anyone wondered how to just load image from file here is how: url = new URL(""file"" ""localhost"" ""resources/image.gif"");  Hopefully it's not too late for this. I managed to get the animated gif inside my JPanel this way: private JPanel loadingPanel() { JPanel panel = new JPanel(); BoxLayout layoutMgr = new BoxLayout(panel BoxLayout.PAGE_AXIS); panel.setLayout(layoutMgr); ClassLoader cldr = this.getClass().getClassLoader(); java.net.URL imageURL = cldr.getResource(""img/spinner.gif""); ImageIcon imageIcon = new ImageIcon(imageURL); JLabel iconLabel = new JLabel(); iconLabel.setIcon(imageIcon); imageIcon.setImageObserver(iconLabel); JLabel label = new JLabel(""Loading...""); panel.add(iconLabel); panel.add(label); return panel; } Some points of this approach: 1. The image file is within the jar; 2. ImageIO.read() returns a BufferedImage which doesn't update the ImageObserver; 3. Another alternative to find images that are bundled in the jar file is to ask the Java class loader the code that loaded your program to get the files. It knows where things are. So by doing this I was able to get my animated gif inside my JPanel and it worked like a charm.  This reads gif animation from inputStream InputStream in = ...; Image image = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().createImage(org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils.toByteArray(in)); This is the definite answer.

1167120,OpenGL Alpha blending with wrong color I am trying to create a simple ray tracer. I have a perspective view which shows the rays visibly for debugging purposes. In my example screenshot below I have a single white sphere to be raytraced and a green sphere representing the eye. Rays are drawn as lines with glLineWidth(10.0f) If a ray misses the sphere it is given color glColor4ub(100100100100); in my initialization code I have the following:  glEnable(GL_ALPHA_TEST); glAlphaFunc(GL_GREATER 0.0f); glEnable(GL_BLEND); glBlendFunc(GL_SRC_ALPHAGL_SRC_ALPHA); You can see in the screen shot that for some reason the rays passing between the perspective view point and the sphere are being color blended with the axis line behind the sphere rather than with the sphere itself. Here is a screenshot: Can anyone explain what I am doing wrong here? Thanks!! I edited to include your screenshot AlphaTest is only for discarding fragments - not for blending them. Check the spec By using it you are telling OpenGL that you want it to throw away the pixels instead of drawing them so you won't can any transparent blending. The most common blending function is glBlendFunc (GL_SRC_ALPHA GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA); You can also check out the OpenGL Transparency FAQ.  You dont need the glAlphaFunc disable it. Light rays should be blended by adding to the buffer: glBlendFunc(GL_ONE GL_ONE) (for premultiplied alpha which you chose. Turn off depth buffer writing (not testing) when rendering the rays: glDepthMask(GL_FALSE) Render the rays last.  Is it a possibility you cast those rays before you draw the sphere? Then if Z-buffer is enabled the sphere's fragments simply won't be rendered as those parts of rays are closer. When you are drawing something semi-transparent (using blending) you should watch the order you draw things carefully. In fact I think you cannot use Z-buffer in any sensible way together with ray-tracing process. You'll have to track Z-order manually. While we are at it OpenGL might not be the best API to visualize ray-tracing process. (It will do so possibly much slower than pure software ray-tracer) @puddlesofjoy: any chance you could edit the question and add the result after this fix? It might be instructive for people to see what your intended result looked like. Not a biggie - just a suggestion. Glad this worked out! Well I'll be... just changing the order of my drawing code is all it took; I had no idea that could effect things so much!! Thank you sir! You are a gentleman and a scholar. Just to clear up my intent for the curious. The actual ray tracing is fully independent of the OpenGL drawing.

Dunno if i understand the question right but if u want to group all the result in groups of 5:  $i =1; while ($row = mysql_fetch_array($query)) { echo $row['name'].""\n""; if ($i % 5 == 0) { echo 'hr'; // Or any other separator you want } $i++; } This answer pretty nice and shortcut solution... thanks buddy",php sql database loops while-loop,4.7167386757286515E-4,7.692121994961024E-4,0.9981686486801769,5.904652527541144E-4
126161,Where do the responsibilities of a Db Abstraction in PHP start and end? In PHP what is the best practice for laying out the responsibilities of a Db Abstraction Layer? Is OOP a good idea in terms of performance? How much should be generic object code and how much should be very specific functions? In most applications I have written there are generally two different types of data access. One is for transactional operations: retrieving specific objects from the datastore modifying them and saving them back. I've found a solid ORM to be the best solution here. Don't try writing your own (as interesting as it might be.) The other common type of data access is for reporting. ORMs aren't the best solution here which is why I usually go with a scheme that uses custom SQL queries. Plain ol' PDO works well here. You can create a special value object just for that report and have the PDO query fetch the values into the object. Reports need to be fast and building them using an ORM layer is usually just too slow and cumbersome.  There are already some great solutions for this. A DAL is not a simple thing especially since so many security concerns are involved. I would suggest checking out PDO and MySQLi. Even if you write a wrapper class for one of them the heavy lifting will be done for you in a robust and secure way.,php sql mysql database,7.652796175992753E-4,0.20355278885921002,0.794723915712057,9.580158111335735E-4
258099,"How to close a Java Swing application from the code What is the proper way to terminate a Swing application from the code and what are the pitfalls? I'd tried to close my application automatically after a timer fires. But just calling dispose() on the JFrame didn't do the trick - the window vanished but the application did not terminate. However when closing the window with the close button the application does terminate. What should I do? Please post up a code snippet of your timer. May be the safe way is something like:  private JButton btnExit; ... btnExit = new JButton(""Quit""); btnExit.addActionListener(new ActionListener() { public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e){ Container frame = btnExit.getParent(); do frame = frame.getParent(); while (!(frame instanceof JFrame)); ((JFrame) frame).dispose(); } }); Pretty bad style to name a variable `Frame` with a capital letter exactly like the name of a class��_  Try: System.exit(0); Crude but effective. System.exit(0) isn't just crude it's evil. Check all frames call dispose. If that fails run a debugger and see what non-daemon threads are still alive. Unfortunately this is too crude for me. I want the window closing events to be processed for some cleanup actions. OK I could do a System.exit with a SwingUtils.invokeLater but I'd rather do the proper thing. There's been plenty of bugs even within the JDK that leave the process about. So +1 to exit() but you might want to disable it in debug builds.  In response to other comments DISPOSE_ON_CLOSE does not seem to properly exit the application - it only destroys the window but the application will continue running. If you want to terminate the application use EXIT_ON_CLOSE. Can't remember how I tested this now. This response suggests the exact opposite of James Schek's answer. Which one is correct? (when I test with a simple application both seem to work ...)  I guess a EXIT_ON_CLOSE frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE); before System.exit(0) is better since you can write a Window Listener to make some cleaning operations before actually leaving the app. That window listener allows you to defined: public void windowClosing(WindowEvent e) { displayMessage(""WindowListener method called: windowClosing.""); //A pause so user can see the message before //the window actually closes. ActionListener task = new ActionListener() { boolean alreadyDisposed = false; public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) { if (frame.isDisplayable()) { alreadyDisposed = true; frame.dispose(); } } }; Timer timer = new Timer(500 task); //fire every half second timer.setInitialDelay(2000); //first delay 2 seconds timer.setRepeats(false); timer.start(); } public void windowClosed(WindowEvent e) { //This will only be seen on standard output. displayMessage(""WindowListener method called: windowClosed.""); }  Take a look at the Oracle Documentation. Starting from JDK 1.4 an Application terminates if: There are no displayable AWT or Swing components. There are no native events in the native event queue. There are no AWT events in java EventQueues. Cornercases: The document states that some packages create displayable components without releasing them.A program which calls Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit() won't terminate. is among others given as an example. Also other Processes can keep AWT alive when they for what ever reason are sending events into the native event queue. Also I noticed that on some Systems it takes a coupple of seconds before the Application actually terminates.  Your JFrame default close action can be set to ""DISPOSE_ON_CLOSE"" instead of EXIT_ON_CLOSE (why people keep using EXIT_ON_CLOSE is beyond me). If you have any undisposed windows or non-daemon threads your application will not terminate. This should be considered a error (and solving it with System.exit is a very bad idea). The most common culprits are java.util.Timer and a custom Thread you've created. Both should be set to daemon or must be explicitly killed. If you want to check for all active frames you can use Frame.getFrames(). If all Windows/Frames are disposed of then use a debugger to check for any non-daemon threads that are still running. In my case I discovered with the debugger that I had a Swingworker still active. I called its cancel(true) method in the WindowClose Eventlistener and the program terminates now. Thanks! Note that you may have to call dispose on each frame and typically that is ""enough"" (though setting the default close action to EXIT_ON_CLOSE is probably not a bad idea either). First window should add itself to as a listener to the second window and take appropriate action. What if you have one window opening another but not disposing itself so that you can use it for a `back` window? If the second window is then closed and you use `DISPOSE_ON_CLOSE` the programme doesn't terminate because the first window is still ""undisposed""... is there a way to solve that _without_ using `DISPOSE_ON_CLOSE`? This response suggests the exact opposite of Bizorke's answer. Which one is correct? (when I test with a simple application both seem to work ...) Using EXIT_ON_CLOSE will forcibly terminate the application. If you need to take action before the program exits (such as saving working data) then you have to tap into the JVM event handlers instead of just using the normal swing event handlers. Both will ""work"" but the EXIT_ON_CLOSE will cause problems for more complex apps. An example in support of graceful shutdown: I needed to ensure my finally block was executed so network connections were closed gracefully. This would not happen with a System.exit call (EXIT_ON_CLOSE).  I think the idea is here the WindowListener - you can add any code there that you'd like to run before the thing shuts down  If I understand you correctly you want to close the application even if the user did not click on the close button. You will need to register WindowEvents maybe with addWindowListener() or enableEvents() whichever suits your needs better. You can then invoke the event with a call to processWindowEvent(). Here is a sample code that will create a JFrame wait 5 seconds and close the JFrame without user interaction. import javax.swing.*; import java.awt.*; import java.awt.event.*; public class ClosingFrame extends JFrame implements WindowListener{ public ClosingFrame(){ super(""A Frame""); setSize(400 400); //in case the user closes the window setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE); setVisible(true); //enables Window Events on this Component this.addWindowListener(this); //start a timer Thread t = new Timer(); t.start(); } public void windowOpened(WindowEvent e){} public void windowClosing(WindowEvent e){} //the event that we are interested in public void windowClosed(WindowEvent e){ System.exit(0); } public void windowIconified(WindowEvent e){} public void windowDeiconified(WindowEvent e){} public void windowActivated(WindowEvent e){} public void windowDeactivated(WindowEvent e){} //a simple timer class Timer extends Thread{ int time = 10; public void run(){ while(time-- > 0){ System.out.println(""Still Waiting:"" + time); try{ sleep(500); }catch(InterruptedException e){} } System.out.println(""About to close""); //close the frame ClosingFrame.this.processWindowEvent( new WindowEvent( ClosingFrame.this WindowEvent.WINDOW_CLOSED)); } } //instantiate the Frame public static void main(String args[]){ new ClosingFrame(); } } As you can see the processWindowEvent() method causes the WindowClosed event to be fired where you have an oportunity to do some clean up code if you require before closing the application. windowClosed should call dispose() not System.exit(0).  The following program includes code that will terminate a program lacking extraneous threads without explicitly calling System.exit(). In order to apply this example to applications using threads/listeners/timers/etc one need only insert cleanup code requesting (and if applicable awaiting) their termination before the WindowEvent is manually initiated within actionPerformed(). For those who wish to copy/paste code capable of running exactly as shown a slightly-ugly but otherwise irrelevant main method is included at the end. public class CloseExample extends JFrame implements ActionListener { private JButton turnOffButton; private void addStuff() { setDefaultCloseOperation(DISPOSE_ON_CLOSE); turnOffButton = new JButton(""Exit""); turnOffButton.addActionListener(this); this.add(turnOffButton); } public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent quitEvent) { /* Iterate through and close all timers threads etc here */ this.processWindowEvent( new WindowEvent( this WindowEvent.WINDOW_CLOSING)); } public CloseExample() { super(""Close Me!""); addStuff(); } public static void main(String[] args) { java.awt.EventQueue.invokeLater(new Runnable() { public void run() { CloseExample cTW = new CloseExample(); cTW.setSize(200 100); cTW.setLocation(300300); cTW.setVisible(true); } }); } }",java swing,9.732914771091204E-5,0.9996451551267761,1.3567416558258358E-4,1.2184155993036482E-4

1704823,"Initializing numpy matrix to something other than zero or one I have the following code: r = numpy.zeros(shape = (width height 9)) It creates a width x height x 9 matrix filled with zeros. Instead I'd like to know if there's a function or way to initialize them instead to NaN. Is there any? Without having to resort to manually doing loops and such? Thanks One caveat is that NumPy doesn't have an integer NA value (unlike R). See [pandas list of gotchas](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/gotchas.html). Hence `np.nan` goes wrong when converted to int. Are you familiar with numpy.nan? You can create your own method such as: def nans(shape dtype=float): a = numpy.empty(shape dtype) a.fill(numpy.nan) return a Then nans([34]) would output array([[ NaN NaN NaN NaN] [ NaN NaN NaN NaN] [ NaN NaN NaN NaN]]) I found this code in a mailing list thread.  You rarely need loops for vector operations in numpy. You can create an uninitialized array and assign to all entries at once: >>> a = numpy.empty((33)) >>> a[:] = numpy.NAN >>> a array([[ NaN NaN NaN] [ NaN NaN NaN] [ NaN NaN NaN]]) I have timed the alternatives a[:] = numpy.nan here and a.fill(numpy.nan) as posted by Blaenk: $ python -mtimeit ""import numpy as np; a = np.empty((100100));"" ""a.fill(np.nan)"" 10000 loops best of 3: 54.3 usec per loop $ python -mtimeit ""import numpy as np; a = np.empty((100100));"" ""a[:] = np.nan"" 10000 loops best of 3: 88.8 usec per loop The timings show a preference for ndarray.fill(..) as the faster alternative. OTOH I like numpy's convenience implementation where you can assign values to whole slices at the time the code's intention is very clear. I agree that your code's intention is clearer. But thanks for the unbiased timings (or rather the fact that you still posted them) I appreciate it :) I like this one: `a = numpy.empty((3 3)) * numpy.nan`. It timed faster than `fill` but slower than the assignment method but it is a oneliner!! Please look at this answer: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10871220/making-a-matrix-square-and-padding-it-with-desired-value-in-numpy I prefer the `.fill()` method but the difference in speeds reduces to practically nothing as the arrays get larger.",python numpy,0.03273170806399973,5.198880841981548E-4,4.44385371801448E-4,0.9663040184800006
1057666,"Using Python to replace MATLAB: how to import data? I want to use some Python libraries to replace MATLAB. How could I import Excel data in Python (for example using NumPy) to use them? I don't know if Python is a credible alternative to MATLAB but I want to try it. Is there a a tutorial? One way to interpret the original question is: how can I read a (proprietary) Excel (.xls .xlsx) file into Python. An answer to this could be useful but I don't have one. So the general flow here is to export in another format from Excel namely CSV. Depending on what kind of computations you are doing with MATLAB (and on which toolboxes you are using) Python could be a good alternative to MATLAB. Python + NumPy + SciPy + Matplotlib are the right combination to start. For the data you can for example save your data directly in text file (assuming that you are not directly concerned by floating-point precision issues) and read it in Python. If your data are Excel data where each value is separated by a "";"" you can for example read the file line by line and use the split() method (with "";"" as argument) to get each value. For MATLAB up to version 7.1 it is possible to directly load .mat files from Python with the scipy.io.matlab.mio module.  If you saved you data in MATLAB format use: from scipy.io import loadmat datafile = ""yourfile.mat"" data = loadmat(datafile matlab_compatible=True) var1 = data['nameOfYourVariable'].squeeze() var2 = data['nameOfYourOtherVariable'].squeeze()  Pandas is a Python data analysis library that can import/export from Excel pretty easily. Here's how to do it: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html#excel Crash course: import pandas as pd data = pd.read_excel('foo.xlsx' 'Sheet1' index_col=None na_values=['NA'])  I had a look at mlabwrap as a step to easing some MATLAB developers into using Python more. But I have been unable to cleanly build it and I don't run production installs here so I'm dead in the water.  If you come from the MATLAB world Pylab will ease your transition. Once you have converted your data to ASCII pylab.load() will do the rest: pylab.load(fname comments='#' delimiter=None converters=None skiprows=0 usecols=None unpack=False dtype=<type 'numpy.float64'>)  There are probably hundreds of ways you could import text data into Python. But since you want to replace MATLAB you're going be using NumPy and probably SciPy. Keep things simple: use NumPy's standard text-loading: import numpy imported_array = numpy.loadtxt('file.txt'delimiter='\t') # Assuming tab-delimiter print imported_array.shape  There's Matplotlib for plots and the csv module for reading Excel data (assuming you can dump to CSV). Here's a tutorial about replacing MATLAB with Python. SAGE (mentionend in the tutorial see http://sagemath.org/) is a pretty cool stack based on Python. Thanx a lot. I'm going to try SAGE.  ""I don't know if Python is a credible alternative to MATLAB"" For me (experimental physics) Python is not only a full replacement for MATLAB (when including SciPy and Matplotlib as mentioned above) but it is useful for many things other than data crunching and visualisation (such are general programming needs). ""I'm going to try SAGE."" It is worth noting that there are a couple of servers running Sage which offer the notebook environmet (check Try Sage online in http://www.sagemath.org/). This is pretty neat given the fact that all you need it is an Internet browser and access (no installation required). As for the question as interpreted by Kevin Buchs (in another answer) reading proprietary Excel to Python can be done in several methods some are platform (OS) dependent: A nice resource (platform independent) - http://www.python-excel.org/ An example using xlrd which I once found useful (this is what I used when I needed it): http://code.activestate.com/recipes/483742/ for an example based on xlrd (platform independent) pyexcelerator is another option.

The best way would be to use the header contstucts that are in DDraw.h here's what I was able to use for DXT13and 5 which if I remember correctly are the only ones that can work in OpenGL.  struct DDS_IMAGE_DATA { GLsizei width; GLsizei height; GLint components; GLenum format; int numMipMaps; GLubyte *pixels; }; DDS_IMAGE_DATA* CImage::loadDDSTextureFile( const char *filename ) { DDS_IMAGE_DATA *pDDSImageData; DDSURFACEDESC2 ddsd; char filecode[4]; FILE *pFile; int factor; int bufferSize; // Open the file pFile = fopen( filename ""rb"" ); if( pFile == NULL ) { #if DEBUG char str[255]; printf( str ""loadDDSTextureFile couldn't find or failed to load \""%s\"""" filename ); #endif return NULL; } // Verify the file is a true .dds file fread( filecode 1 4 pFile ); if( strncmp( filecode ""DDS "" 4 ) != 0 ) { #if DEBUG char str[255]; printf( str ""The file \""%s\"" doesn't appear to be a valid .dds file!"" filename ); #endif fclose( pFile ); return NULL; } // Get the surface descriptor fread( &ddsd sizeof(ddsd) 1 pFile ); pDDSImageData = (DDS_IMAGE_DATA*) malloc(sizeof(DDS_IMAGE_DATA)); memset( pDDSImageData 0 sizeof(DDS_IMAGE_DATA) ); // // This .dds loader supports the loading of compressed formats DXT1 DXT3 // and DXT5. // switch( ddsd.ddpfPixelFormat.dwFourCC ) { case FOURCC_DXT1: // DXT1's compression ratio is 8:1 pDDSImageData->format = GL_COMPRESSED_RGBA_S3TC_DXT1_EXT; factor = 2; break; case FOURCC_DXT3: // DXT3's compression ratio is 4:1 pDDSImageData->format = GL_COMPRESSED_RGBA_S3TC_DXT3_EXT; factor = 4; break; case FOURCC_DXT5: // DXT5's compression ratio is 4:1 pDDSImageData->format = GL_COMPRESSED_RGBA_S3TC_DXT5_EXT; factor = 4; break; default: #if DEBUG char str[255]; printf( str ""The file \""%s\"" doesn't appear to be compressed "" ""using DXT1 DXT3 or DXT5!"" filename ); #endif return NULL; } // // How big will the buffer need to be to load all of the pixel data // including mip-maps? // if( ddsd.dwLinearSize == 0 ) { #if DEBUG printf(""dwLinearSize is 0!""); #endif } if( ddsd.dwMipMapCount > 1 ) bufferSize = ddsd.dwLinearSize * factor; else bufferSize = ddsd.dwLinearSize; pDDSImageData->pixels = (unsigned char*)malloc(bufferSize * sizeof(unsigned char)); fread( pDDSImageData->pixels 1 bufferSize pFile ); // Close the file fclose( pFile ); pDDSImageData->width = ddsd.dwWidth; pDDSImageData->height = ddsd.dwHeight; pDDSImageData->numMipMaps = ddsd.dwMipMapCount; if( ddsd.ddpfPixelFormat.dwFourCC == FOURCC_DXT1 ) pDDSImageData->components = 3; else pDDSImageData->components = 4; return pDDSImageData; } void CImage::loadDDS(const char * szFilename tTexture & texData) { DDS_IMAGE_DATA *pDDSImageData = loadDDSTextureFile(szFilename); if( pDDSImageData != NULL ) { texData.m_nHeight = pDDSImageData->height; texData.m_nWidth = pDDSImageData->width; texData.m_nHeight = pDDSImageData->height; texData.m_eFormat = pDDSImageData->format; int nHeight = pDDSImageData->height; int nWidth = pDDSImageData->width; int nNumMipMaps = pDDSImageData->numMipMaps; int nBlockSize; if( pDDSImageData->format == GL_COMPRESSED_RGBA_S3TC_DXT1_EXT ) nBlockSize = 8; else nBlockSize = 16; //glGenTextures( 1 &g_compressedTextureID ); //glBindTexture( GL_TEXTURE_2D g_compressedTextureID ); glTexParameteri( GL_TEXTURE_2D GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER GL_LINEAR ); glTexParameteri( GL_TEXTURE_2D GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER GL_LINEAR ); int nSize; int nOffset = 0; // Load the mip-map levels for( int i = 0; i < nNumMipMaps; ++i ) { if( nWidth == 0 ) nWidth = 1; if( nHeight == 0 ) nHeight = 1; nSize = ((nWidth+3)/4) * ((nHeight+3)/4) * nBlockSize; glCompressedTexImage2DARB( GL_TEXTURE_2D i pDDSImageData->format nWidth nHeight 0 nSize pDDSImageData->pixels + nOffset ); nOffset += nSize; // Half the image size for the next mip-map level... nWidth = (nWidth / 2); nHeight = (nHeight / 2); } } if( pDDSImageData != NULL ) { if( pDDSImageData->pixels != NULL ) free( pDDSImageData->pixels ); free( pDDSImageData ); } } This particular bit of code makes a few assumptions of the DDS file we are trying to load first that is is a compressed file either DXT13 or 5 and that the DDS file has pre-generated mipmaps saved in it hence we don't have to generate them ourselves. I hope this was able to help you it took me some time to get it working correctly myself. If there's anything in this code snippet that seems unclear let me know and I'll help you further. Thanks for your help but i've tested my headers and they are fine i copied them from MSDN and since i only use width/height in my code there cant be header related errors plus i've tested with static numbers without using headers at all. I noticed your code has RGBA so i tried with it too but that didnt make any difference... I cant test your code because i dont have the needed type definitions: CImage tTexture DDSURFACEDESC2 FOURCC_DXT1 FOURCC_DXT3 FOURCC_DXT5. Anyways cant i use DDS images unless i make miplevels in them?  The format argument that you're passing to glCompressedTexImage2D looks a bit odd: glCompressedTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D 0 GL_PALETTE4_R5_G6_B5_OES img_width img_height 0 maxsize imgdata); I think this is neither a paletted texture nor an OpenGL ES extension. Perhaps something like GL_COMPRESSED_RGB_S3TC_DXT1_EXT would work better. glewIsSupported(""EXT_texture_compression_dxt1"") returns false :/ what can i do to get this thing working? Woops I forgot the GL_ prefix; try GL_EXT_texture_compression_dxt1. If it still returns false then your platform doesn't support DXT1 compression so you'll need to convert your source data to some other format. yeah still returns false i dont quite understand how this is going to help me to make this DDS thing to work? what code you use to use DDS images in your applications? can you share it? my GFX card surely supports DDS thats a fact. i have tried with that too and all the possible format types you can give there every of them results in a crash. Make sure your OpenGL implementation supports the DXT1 extension. You can do so by calling the glewIsSupported function and passing in the following string: ""EXT_texture_compression_dxt1"".",c++ opengl directdraw dds-format,0.9980392202003784,0.0017499895791718376,1.110564693302434E-4,9.97337511194731E-5

How should I use JOIN to fetch a record from the tables below when the only given variable is the ad_id? category and category options are filled in manually i.e. the users may not alter them. So they are only reference tables but I am not sure this is how I should do it... I have 6 tables: category: cat_id (PK) cat_name category_options: option_id (PK) cat_id (FK) option_name option_value: value_id (PK) (AI) // I think this should have Auto Increment option_id (FK) classified_id (FK) value classified: (THIS IS THE MAIN TABLE YOU COULD SAY) classified_id (PK) (AI) ad_id cat_id headline description area: // I am thinking about moving these fields over to the posters table right? area_id (PK) classified_id (FK) area description Here is how I insert a classified into the tables: mysql_query(""INSERT INTO classified (ad_id cat_id headline description) VALUES ('$ad_id' $cat_id '$headline' '$description')""); $last_classified_id=mysql_insert_id(); mysql_query(""INSERT INTO poster (classified_id name email tel) VALUES ($last_classified_id '$name' '$email' '$tel')""); mysql_query(""INSERT INTO area (classified_id area community) VALUES ($last_classified_id '$area' '$community')""); I am new to JOIN! Every category has sub options (CARS -> color) and every option has a value. I want to only by having the ad_id select all this information. How can I do so? And should I merge the area and posters table? Also please take a careful look at my db and tell me if there is anything I might have missed... This is really out of my knowledge-base so detailed explanations are appreciated! Thanks This is an example of joining some of your tables to get data from more than one of them: SELECT c.cat_name co.option_name cl.headline FROM category c INNER JOIN category_options co ON co.cat_id = c.cat_id INNER JOIN classified cl ON cl.cat_id = c.cat_id WHERE cl.ad_id = {Your ad_id} You can join to any other tables needed in the same way (poster area). Edit (response to comment): The 'c' 'cl' and 'co' are aliases for the 'category' 'classified' and 'category_option' tables. They don't have anything to do with the join. Here's a source. When I say FROM category c that allows me to use 'c' as the a shortcut for the category table. Using aliases allows you to make the select/joins/where clause how I did instead of like this: SELECT category.cat_name category_options.option_name classified.headline FROM category INNER JOIN category_options ON category_options.cat_id = category.cat_id INNER JOIN classified ON classified.cat_id = category.cat_id WHERE classified.ad_id = {Your ad_id} Basically it's a shortcut that can save you some typing. what is the c for in c.cat_name? or the ""co"" or ""cl""... know any tutorial on this type of JOIN?  It looks like you have two fields that could be the primary key in classified: classified_id and ad_id. Then you have two other tables poster and area that have a one-to-one correlation with classified. If this is the case you could put all the fields in classified. A query to join the tables in your insert statements would like like this: select classified.ad_id classified.classified_id classified.headline classified.description AS classified_description poster.name poster.email poster.tel area.area area.description AS area_description from classified inner join poster on classified.ad_id = poster.classified_id inner join area on classified.classified_id where classified.ad_id = 123 Sounds good now that you mention it... Could you also take a look and let me know how to fetch a complete record from only having the ad_id... BTW I have the ad_id only because it is a varchar (BMW_330_8392829 for example) which I then have in the URL and some other reasons as well.

1569939,Rendering different triangle types and triangle fans using vertex buffer objects? (OpenGL) About half of my meshes are using triangles another half using triangle fans. I'd like to offload these into a vertex buffer object but I'm not quite sure how to do this. The triangle fans all have a different number of vertices... for example one might have 5 and another 7. VBO's are fairly straight forward using plain triangles however I'm not sure how to use them with triangle fans or with different triangle types. I'm fairly sure I need an index buffer but I'm not quite sure what I need to do this. I know how many vertices make up each fan during run time... I'm thinking I can use that to call something like glArrayElement Any help here would be much appreciated! VBOs and index buffers are an orthogonal things. If you're not using index buffers yet maybe it is wiser to move one step at a time. So... regarding your question. If you put all your triangle fans in a vbo the only thing you need to draw them is to setup your vbo and pass the index in it for your fan start  glBindBuffer(GL_VERTEX_BUFFER buffer); glVertexPointer(3 GL_FLOAT 0 NULL); // 3 floats per vertex for each i in fans glDrawArrays(GL_TRIANGLE_FAN indef_of_first_vertex_for_fan[i] fan_vertex_count[i]) Edit: I'd have to say that you're probably better off transforming your fans to a regular triangle set and use glDrawArrays(GL_TRIANGLES) for all your triangles. A call per primitive is rarely efficient. Well if you have 200K triangle fans then you have that many calls **per frame**. Think about the cost compared to some load-time (or better off-line process time) that's required to transform the fans to triangles. sun proposed an extension because this was too much of an overhead *10 years ago*. The overhead/intersting work ratio only increased since. http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/SUN/triangle_list.txt To be complete I should add that [primitive restart](http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/NV/primitive_restart.txt) is an extension that you could be using as well (but requires indexing of your primitives which you should look at anyways). [glMultiDrawArrays](http://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man/xhtml/glMultiDrawArrays.xml) is yet another attempt at reducing the overhead but is rarely actually optimized in the drivers. Bahbar Thanks for the tip! I had read about transforming the fans into triangles... However I might have 200000 triangle fan primitives. Granted I'd only need to do this once so in your opinion is it cheaper to transform them and then do glDrawArrays or should I just do the call for each prim? Thanks Good stuff thanks man.

286727,"Java KeyListener for JFrame is being unresponsive? I'm trying to implement a KeyListener into my JFrame. On the constructor I'm using this code: System.out.println(""test""); addKeyListener(new KeyListener() { public void keyPressed(KeyEvent e) { System.out.println( ""tester""); } public void keyReleased(KeyEvent e) { System.out.println(""2test2""); } public void keyTyped(KeyEvent e) { System.out.println(""3test3""); } }); When I run it the test message comes up in my console. However when I press a key I don't get any of the other messages as if the KeyListener was not even there. I was thinking that it could be because the focus is not on the JFrame and so they KeyListener doesn't recieve any events but I'm pretty sure it is. Is there something that I am missing? I got the same problem until i read that the real problem is about FOCUS the your JFrame has already added Listeners but tour frame is never on Focus because you got a lot of components inside your JFrame that also are focusable so try: JFrame.setFocusable(true); Good Luck Great!This is the right answer! I found that this works only until I use something that is on my JFrame then the KeyListener no longer responds  You must add your keyListener to every component that you need. Only the component with the focus will send these events. For instance if you have only one TextBox in your JFrame that TextBox has the focus. So you must add a KeyListener to this component as well. The process is the same: myComponent.addKeyListener(new KeyListener ...); Note: Some components aren't focusable like JLabel. For setting them to focusable you need to: myComponent.setFocusable(true); yea you were right when the program starts you can slightly see that the focus is on the button A. adding a keylistener to each button fixed this. thats a little weird i would think that adding a keylistener to the JFrame would work but i guess not. Thanks!  This should help  yourJFrame.setFocusable(true); yourJFrame.addKeyListener(new java.awt.event.KeyAdapter() { @Override public void keyTyped(KeyEvent e) { System.out.println(""you typed a key""); } @Override public void keyPressed(KeyEvent e) { System.out.println(""you pressed a key""); } @Override public void keyReleased(KeyEvent e) { System.out.println(""you released a key""); } });  InputMaps and ActionMaps were designed to capture the key events for the component it and all of its sub-components or the entire window. This is controlled through the parameter in JComponent.getInputMap(). See How to Use Key Bindings for documentation. The beauty of this design is that one can pick and choose which key strokes are important to monitor and have different actions fired based on those key strokes. This code will call dispose() on a JFrame when the escape key is hit anywhere in the window. JFrame doesn't derive from JComponent so you have to use another component in the JFrame to create the key binding. The content pane might be such a component. InputMap inputMap; ActionMap actionMap; AbstractAction action; JComponent component; inputMap = component.getInputMap(JComponent.WHEN_IN_FOCUSED_WINDOW); actionMap = component.getActionMap(); action = new AbstractAction() { @Override public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) { dispose(); } }; inputMap.put(KeyStroke.getKeyStroke(KeyEvent.VK_ESCAPE 0) ""dispose""); actionMap.put(""dispose"" action);  You could have custom JComponents set their parent JFrame focusable. Just add a constructor and pass in the JFrame. Then make a call to setFocusable() in paintComponent. This way the JFrame will always receive KeyEvents regardless of whether other components are pressed. -1 definitely not - that's complete in more than one respect: a) indecent subclassing b) indecent reference passing c) inappropriate state change while painting d) ..  lol .... all you have to do is make sure that addKeyListener(this); is placed correctly in your code. You should really explain the ""correct place"" to make this a helpful answer.  If you don't want to register a listener on every component you could add your own KeyEventDispatcher to the KeyboardFocusManager: public class MyFrame extends JFrame { private class MyDispatcher implements KeyEventDispatcher { @Override public boolean dispatchKeyEvent(KeyEvent e) { if (e.getID() == KeyEvent.KEY_PRESSED) { System.out.println(""tester""); } else if (e.getID() == KeyEvent.KEY_RELEASED) { System.out.println(""2test2""); } else if (e.getID() == KeyEvent.KEY_TYPED) { System.out.println(""3test3""); } return false; } } public MyFrame() { add(new JTextField()); System.out.println(""test""); KeyboardFocusManager manager = KeyboardFocusManager.getCurrentKeyboardFocusManager(); manager.addKeyEventDispatcher(new MyDispatcher()); } public static void main(String[] args) { MyFrame f = new MyFrame(); f.pack(); f.setVisible(true); } } KeyboardFocusManager is application wide if you have multi frames you will get trouble? So this should work something like: foreach(""focusable components in the frame"" as _){ _.addkeylistener(frameKeylistener);}  in order to capture key events of ALL text fields in a JFrame one can employ a key event post processor. Here is a working example after you add the obvious includes. public class KeyListenerF1Demo extends JFrame implements KeyEventPostProcessor { public static final long serialVersionUID = 1L; public KeyListenerF1Demo() { setTitle(getClass().getName()); // Define two labels and two text fields all in a row. setLayout(new FlowLayout()); JLabel label1 = new JLabel(""Text1""); label1.setName(""Label1""); add(label1); JTextField text1 = new JTextField(10); text1.setName(""Text1""); add(text1); JLabel label2 = new JLabel(""Text2""); label2.setName(""Label2""); add(label2); JTextField text2 = new JTextField(10); text2.setName(""Text2""); add(text2); // Register a key event post processor. KeyboardFocusManager.getCurrentKeyboardFocusManager() .addKeyEventPostProcessor(this); } public static void main(String[] args) { JFrame f = new KeyListenerF1Demo(); f.setName(""MyFrame""); f.pack(); f.setVisible(true); } @Override public boolean postProcessKeyEvent(KeyEvent ke) { // Check for function key F1 pressed. if (ke.getID() == KeyEvent.KEY_PRESSED && ke.getKeyCode() == KeyEvent.VK_F1) { // Get top level ancestor of focused element. Component c = ke.getComponent(); while (null != c.getParent()) c = c.getParent(); // Output some help. System.out.println(""Help for "" + c.getName() + ""."" + ke.getComponent().getName()); // Tell keyboard focus manager that event has been fully handled. return true; } // Let keyboard focus manager handle the event further. return false; } } For a working example you might consider adding the imports. I usually add 'package imports' to keep them short. Otherwise +1. Interesting technique.  Deion (and anyone else asking a similar question) you could use Peter's code above but instead of printing to standard output you test for the key code PRESSED RELEASED or TYPED. @Override public boolean dispatchKeyEvent(KeyEvent e) { if (e.getID() == KeyEvent.KEY_PRESSED) { if (e.getKeyCode() == KeyEvent.VK_F4) { dispose(); } } else if (e.getID() == KeyEvent.KEY_RELEASED) { if (e.getKeyCode() == KeyEvent.VK_F4) { dispose(); } } else if (e.getID() == KeyEvent.KEY_TYPED) { if (e.getKeyCode() == KeyEvent.VK_F4) { dispose(); } } return false; }  Hmm.. what class is your constructor for? Probably some class extending JFrame? The window focus should be at the window of course but I don't think that's the problem. I expanded your code tried to run it and it worked - the key presses resulted as print output. (run with Ubuntu through Eclipse): public class MyFrame extends JFrame { public MyFrame() { System.out.println(""test""); addKeyListener(new KeyListener() { public void keyPressed(KeyEvent e) { System.out.println(""tester""); } public void keyReleased(KeyEvent e) { System.out.println(""2test2""); } public void keyTyped(KeyEvent e) { System.out.println(""3test3""); } }); } public static void main(String[] args) { MyFrame f = new MyFrame(); f.pack(); f.setVisible(true); } } I get all of the messages output also. Run in Windows command line. You get all the messages because in this example the JFrame has the focus. try adding a TextBox component to the JFrame and see what happens.  I have been having the same problem. I followed Bruno's advice to you and found that adding a KeyListener just to the ""first"" button in the JFrame (ie on the top left) did the trick. But I agree with you it is kind of an unsettling solution. So I fiddled around and discovered a neater way to fix it. Just add the line myChildOfJFrame.requestFocusInWindow(); to your main method after you've created your instance of your subclass of JFrame and set it visible.  KeyListener is low level and applies only to a single component. Despite attempts to make it more usable JFrame creates a number of component components the most obvious being the content pane. JComboBox UI is also often implemented in a similar manner. It's worth noting the mouse events work in a strange way slightly different to key events.

481379,Java: Handle logoff or shutdown on Windows and Linux Is there a way for a Java GUI application to respond to system shutdown or logoff events other than to use JNI? (On Windows the JNI would use WM_QUERYENDSESSION on Linux?) The method should allow the program to prompt users to save etc. and then continue the logoff process. You can schedule a Thread to be run on JVM shutdown - see http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/Runtime.html#addShutdownHook(java.lang.Thread)  This doesn't answer the question but addresses part of it. In a Unix GUI session I consider the right way to handle the logoff event is to save the document to a temporary file and save the information in the session state. During the session recovery the program can reload the temporary file and take up where it left off. No need to ask the user about saving or not. I just wish more software did transparent session save and recovery. Too many programs reopen with empty document windows because the GUI framework used does that much but none of the rest of the work has been done to actually handle any meaningful program state.  I think that Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook should provide the functionality you need.  As far as I know there's no way in Java to catch the system shutdown or logoff events. You can however catch when the JVM is terminating by adding a shutdown hook. AWT's WindowAdapter also has a windowClosing event that you can override and hook to a window that you want to monitor. Swing inherits this; I believe SWT does as well. Be aware that you MUST manually dispose of the window if you override this event! I believe that MS Windows will fire these events as it is closing. I believe a SIGTERM on Linux/UNIX does the same although Linux will SIGKILL an app shortly afterwords if this is during shutdown. Beware AWT's WindowAdapter will only hook to events on the window. If the environment is terminated using shutdown the windowClosing or windowClosed events will not fire!,java windows linux swing,4.0891971730476256E-4,0.9985091509721555,5.700228835906011E-4,5.119064269491196E-4

Use this: SELECT * FROM table WHERE thread = $thread (AND user != $user1 AND user != $user2) Because you don't want if the user is either of user1 or user2 for this reason using 'AND' will be proper option here. Also if the $thread is not an integer field you need enclose it in quotes eg: WHERE thread = '$thread'  Use: SELECT t.* FROM TABLE t WHERE t.thread = mysql_real_escape_string($thread) AND t.user NOT IN (mysql_real_escape_string($user1) mysql_real_escape_string($user2)) Please use mysql_real_escape_string or risk SQL injection attacks.

536314,Texturing Spheres with Cubemaps (not reflection maps) I want to texture a sphere with a cube map. So far my research has thrown up many many results on Google involving making OpenGL auto generate texture coordinates but I want to generate my own coordinates. Given an array of coordinates comprising the vertexes of an imperfect sphere (height mapped but essentially a sphere) centered on 000 how would one generate texture coordinates for a cube map? Are you doing this via GLSL? In that case textureCube accepts a vec3 as texture coordinate which is a unit vector on a sphere. In your case you would take the coordinate of your fragment with respect to the center of the sphere normalize it and pass it as a coordinate. No need to worry about the internal representation as six two-dimensional textures. uniform samplerCube cubemap; varying vec3 pos; // position of the fragment w.r.t. the center of the sphere /* ... */ vec4 color = textureCube(cubemap normalize(pos).stp); It works like that also in fixed-pipeline OpenGL. By the way here is how the coordinates are used internally: the largest coordinate in absolute value is used to select which one of the six textures is read from (the sign selects positive or negative). The other two coordinates are used to lookup the texel in the selected map after being divided by the largest coordinate. *slaps head* thankyou!

What about `numpy.array([numpy.array([1]) numpy.array([2])])`? `numpy.array(['1'])`? ""Testing by trying to do math"" will not catch `bool` values or numpy arrays of them. In general the flexible fast and pythonic way to handle unknown types is to just perform some operation on them and catch an exception on invalid types. try: a = 5+'5' except TypeError: print ""Oops"" Seems to me that this approach is easier than special-casing out some function to determine absolute type certainty. It is not an answer to the question but I agree completely. The problem is that '5'*5 does work. @JF that's true but I still like this answer to this question. I think the str*int bug will be easier to catch than the is_numeric function will be to write. Also consider that IIRC no other mathematical operation is defined where the two operands are str and int. I like it too... if only I could accept more than one ;-) `TrueFalse` (and numpy arrays of them) ""look like numbers"" by this test.  isinstance(numpy.int32(4) numbers.Number) returns False so that doesn't quite work. operator.isNumberType() does work on all the variants of numpy numbers however including numpy.array([1]).  Your is_numeric is ill-defined. See my comments to your question. Other numerical types could be: long complex fractions.Fraction numpy.bool_ numpy.ubyte ... operator.isNumberType() returns True for Python numbers and numpy.array. Since Python 2.6 you can use isinstance(d numbers.Number) instead of deprecated operator.isNumberType(). Generally it is better to check the capabilities of the object (e.g. whether you can add an integer to it) and not its type. Yeah but if I had an exact definition in mind I could have written the function ;-) I edited in some more information.  As others have answered there could be other numeric types besides the ones you mention. One approach would be to check explicitly for the capabilities you want with something like def is_numeric(obj): attrs = ['__add__' '__sub__' '__mul__' '__div__' '__pow__'] return all(hasattr(obj attr) for attr in attrs) This works for all your examples except the last one numpy.array(['1']). That's because numpy.ndarray has the special methods for numeric operations but raises TypeError if you try to use them inappropriately with string or object arrays. You could add an explicit check for this like  ... and not (isinstance(obj ndarray) and obj.dtype.kind in 'OSU') This may be good enough. But... you can never be 100% sure that somebody won't define another type with the same behavior so a more foolproof way is to actually try to do a calculation and catch the exception something like def is_numeric_paranoid(obj): try: obj+obj obj-obj obj*obj obj**obj obj/obj except ZeroDivisionError: return True except Exception: return False else: return True but depending on how often you plan to call use it and with what arguments this may not be practical (it can be potentially slow e.g. with large arrays). `TrueFalse` and numpy arrays of them look like numbers by these tests so they'd need to be included in the `and not` clause; assuming that you don't want to do math on them.  Also numpy has numpy.isreal and other similar functions (numpy.is + Tab should list them). They all have their fun corner cases but one of those could be useful.",python numpy,2.2531197151775382E-4,3.674418472149104E-4,0.009477483399558716,0.9899297627817085
1846836,"the best shortest path algorithm what is the difference between the ""Floyd-Warshall algorithm"" and ""Dijkstra's Algorithm"" and which is the best for finding the shortest path in a graph?

If we close this as dup how will the author find out more about the previous question? Will we really all be nice enough to go over there and vote to reopen? hi sorry but wanted to add an array example with respect to a picture but I did not do thanks SilentGhost for re-edit my question Shouldn't DE in that graph be 15? In the meanwhile better algorithms for the single source shortest path problem are known. A practically relevant one is a derivation of Dijkstra's algorithm by Torben Hagerup. The algorithm has the same worst case complexity as Djikstra's but in the average case the expected runtime is linear in the size of the graph which is much faster than the pure Dijkstra. The idea of the algorithm is based on the idea that there is no need to always poll the minimum edge from the queue. It is possible poll an edge from the queue whose weight is 1+k times as large as the minimum edge weight where k is some number larger 0. Even if such an edge is chosen the algorithm will still find the shortest path.  Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path between a node and every other node in the graph. You'd run it once for every node. Weights must be non-negative so if necessary you have to normalise the values in the graph first. Floyd-Warshall calculates the shortest routes between all pairs of nodes in a single run! Cycle weights must be non-negative and the graph must be directed (your diagram is not). Johnson's algorithm is using Dijkstra's algorithm to find all pairs in a single pass and is faster for sparse trees (see the link for analysis). From the wikipedia link you cite for Dijkstra: ""the algorithm finds the path with lowest cost between that vertex and **every** other vertex"" (my emphasis). You thus don't need to run it for every pair of vertex but only for every vertex. thx Andreas fixed You can convert an undirected graph to a directed graph by replacing every edge uv with two edges (uv) and (vu) with the same weight. Then presumably Floyd-Warshall should work just fine? err .. floyd-warshall does not require it to have non-negative edges from wikipedia ""is a graph analysis algorithm for finding shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights (but with no negative cycles)""  Floyd Warshall find the paths between all pairs of vertices but Dijkstra only finds the path from one vertex to all others. Floyd Warshall is O(|V|3) and Dikstra is O(|E| + |V| log |V|) but you'll have to run it V times to find all pairs which gives a complexity of O(|E * V| + |V2| log |V|) I guess. This means it's possibly faster to use Dijsktra repeatedly than the FW algorithm I would try both approaches and see which one is fastest in the actual case. Francis Haart's comment: ""@Andreas Brinck in a complete graph E=(V^2-V)/2 and dijkstra's would be no faster.""  Use the Floyd-Warshall algorithm if you want to find the shortest path between all pairs of vertexes as it has a (far) higher running time than Dijkstra's algorithm. The Floyd-Warshall algorithm has a worst case performance of O(|V|3) where as Dijkstra's has a worse case performance of O(|E| + |V|log |V|)  Dijkstra's is mainly for single pair shortest path finding i.e. from one node to all other nodes where as Floyd-Warshall is for all-pair shortest path i.e. shortest path between all pair of vertices. The Floyd-Warshall algorithm has a worst case performance of O(|V|3) where as Dijkstra's has a worse case performance of O(|E| + |V|log |V|) Also Dijkstra's cannot be used for negative weights ( we use Bellmann Ford for the same ). but for Floyd-Warshall we can use negative weights but no negative cycles  Dijkstra finds the shortest path from only one vertex Floyd-Warshall finds it between all of them.",python algorithm numpy shortest-path,0.03411443110951188,3.0233666642380297E-4,2.584286810981095E-4,0.9653248035429662
1691538,"What 3D graphics framework should I use for a real world game engine? I'm a C++ programmer with very extensive server programming experience. I'm however fairly bored at the moment and I decided to tackle a new area: 3D game programming for learning purposes. Additionally I think this learning project may turn out to be good resume material in the future should I decide to work in this area. Instead of creating a 3D engine from scratch I decided to emulate as exactly as I'm able an existing one: World of Warcraft's. If you are curious as to why (feel free to skip this): It's a real world successful game All the map textures models and what not are already done (I'm not interested in learning how to actually draw a texture with photoshop or whatever) Their file formats have been more or less completely reverse engineered There is already an identical open source project (wowmapview) that I can look at if I'm in trouble. ok that was a long preface.. Now my main question is the following: Should I use DirectX OpenGL wrapper libraries such as sdl or what? What's the most used one in the real world? And something else that perplexes me: World of Warcraft appears to be using both! In fact normally it uses DirectX but you can use opengl by starting it with the ""-opengl"" switch via command line. Is this something common in games? Why did they do it? I imagine it's a lot of work and from my understanding nobody uses OpenGL anyway (very very few people know about the secret switch at all). If it's something usually done do programmers usually create their own 3d engine ""wrapper"" something like SDL made in house and based on switches / #defines / whatnot decide which API function to ultimately call (DirectX or OpenGL)? Or is this functionality already built in in sdl (you can switch between DirectX and OpenGL at will)? And finally do you have any books to suggest? Thanks! ""Why did they do it?"" Because Mac OsX doesn't have DirectX support? SDL is merely a platform abstraction layer it substitutes neither OpenGL nor DirectX. When SDL is used though it is more commonly used with OpenGL since both cross platform libraries. Also worth noting is that SDL doesn't provide a widget toolkit so if that's a requirement (not very common in fullscreen 3D games) something like Qt might be a better choice for a cross platform application. @gf: good point. Makes me wonder now why they don't support linux natively since they went through all the trouble to make OpenGL work for mac.. should only need relatively trivial changes. oh well guess I'll never find out. Blizzard do or at least did at some point have an internal unsupported build for Linux but it's never been released. I'm pretty sure they're using SDL too since Slouken WoW's lead interface programmer is also the author of SDL... take a look at this as well http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/90/why-is-it-so-hard-to-develop-a-mmo this is my favorite post when I think I am boring and decide to do some game for fun especially WOW like . ^_^ You might want to look at some projects that encapsulate the low level 3d api in a higher level interface that is api independent such as Ogre3D. As you are doing this to learn I assume you probably will be more interesting in implementing the low level detail yourself but you could probably learn a lot from such a project. Or irrlicht or openscenegraph Indeed all good.  if you are really only interested in the rendering part i can suggest ogre3d. it is clean c++ tested and cross-platform. i used it in two projects and compared to other experiences (torque3d for example) i liked the good support (tutorials/wiki/forum) and the not so steep learning curve. i think someone can also learn a lot by looking at the sourcecode and the concepts they have used in the design. there is a accompanying book as well which is a bit outdated but it is good for the start the problem with this is you will be thinking inside this engine and soon you will need gameplay-like (timers events) elements for simulating and testing your effects or whatever you want to do. so you will end up working around ogre3ds shortcomings (it is not a game engine) and implement in on your own or use another middleware. so if you really want to touch 3d rendering first i would take some computer graphics books (gpu gems shaderx) and see some tutorials and demos on the web and start building my own basic framework. this is for the experience and i think you will learn the most from this approach. at least i did ...  If you just want it to work on Windows then DirectX is a good choice. Your first decision will be to look at what is available for both OpenGL and DirectX and decide which will give you more of what you want with less work. If you have an old version of DirectX and don't want to upgrade you may want to use OpenGL but the main reason for the switch is for support on non-windows machines. Since you are using C++ you can pick either option. If you use a library or wrapper it will simplify your life but then you will need to design within the limits of the libraries. You may want to use Lua for much of the top-level parts of your application as that is what WoW is using and then where you need you can go lower-level to limit how much low-level work you need to do. I'm already familiar with Lua and I've used it extensively in the non performance critical parts of my server projects I love it! However I wanted to focus on the actual 3d and rendering engine not the interface so I don't think I will be using it for this project. Then just first decide what requirements you have such as OS and peripheral support as support will differ between OpenGL and DirectX. I decided I'll go with DirectX (at least at first) thanks! Nice choice it comes with so much when you have just installed it. Try to avoid making shapes with individual triangles fans will be your friend. :)  I realize you already accepted an answer but I think this deserves some more comments. Sorry to quote you out of order I'm answering by what I think is important. Instead of creating a 3D engine from scratch I decided to emulate as exactly as I'm able an existing one: World of Warcraft's. However I wanted to focus on the actual 3d and rendering engine not the interface so I don't think I will be using it [lua] for this project. From these two snippets I can tell you that you are not trying to emulate the game engine. Just the 3D rendering backend. It's not the same thing and the rendering backend part is very small part compared to the full game engine. This by the way can help answer one of your questions: World of Warcraft appears to be using both! In fact normally it uses DirectX but you can use opengl by starting it with the ""-opengl"" switch via command line. Yep they implemented both. The amount of work to do that is non-negligeable but the rendering back-end in my experience is at most 10% of the total code usually less. So it's not that outraging to implement multiple ones. More to the point the programming part of a game engine today is not the biggest chunk. It's the asset production that is the bulk (and that includes most game programming. Most lua scripts are considered on that side of things e.g.) For WoW OSX support meant OpenGL. So they did it. They wanted to support older hardware too... So they support DX8-level hardware. That's already 3 backends. I'm not privy to how many they actually implement but it all boils down to what customer base they wanted to reach. Multiple back-ends in a game engine is something that is more or less required to scale to all graphics cards/OSs/platforms. I have not seen a single real game engine that did not support multiple backends (even first party titles tend to support an alternate back-end for debugging purposes). ok that was a long preface.. Now my main question is the following: Should I use DirectX OpenGL wrapper libraries such as sdl or what? Well this depends strongly on what you want to get out of it. I might add that your option list is not quite complete: DirectX9 DirectX10 DirectX11 OpenGL < 3.1 (before deprecated API is removed) OpenGL >= 3.1 OpenGL ES 1.1 (only if you need to. It's not programmable) OpenGL ES 2.0 Yep those APIs are different enough that you need to decide which ones you want to handle. If you want to learn the very basics of 3D rendering any of those can work. OpenGL < 3.1 tends to hide a lot of things that ultimately has to happen in user code for the other ones (e.g. Matrix manipulation see this plug). The DX SDKs do come with a lot of samples that help understand the basic concepts but they also tend to use the latest and greatest features of DX when it's not necessarily required when starting (e.g. using Geometry shader to render sprites...) On the other hand most GL tutorials tend to use features that are essentially non-performant on modern hardware (e.g. glBegin/glEnd selection/picking ... see the list of things that got removed from GL 3.1 or this other plug) and tend to seed the wrong concepts for a lot of things. What's the most used one in the real world? For games DirectX9 is the standard today in PC world. By a far margin. However I'm expecting DirectX11 to grab more market share as it allows for some more multithreaded work. It's unfortunately significantly more complicated than DX9. nobody uses OpenGL anyway (very very few people know about the secret switch at all). Ask the Mac owners what they think. Side question do you really think hardware vendors would spend any energy in OpenGL drivers if this was really the case (I realize I generalize your comment sorry)? there are real world usages of it. Not much in games though. And Apple makes OpenGL more relevant through the iphone (well OpenGL ES really). If it's something usually done do programmers usually create their own 3d engine ""wrapper"" It's usually a full part of the engine design. Mind you it's not abstracting the API at the same level it's usually more at a ""draw this with all its bells and whistles over there"". Which rendering algorithm to apply on that draw tends to be back-end specific. This however is very game engine dependent. If you want to understand better you could look at UE3 it just got released free (beer) for non-commercial use (I have not looked at it yet so I don't know if they exposed the backends but it's worth a look). To get back to my comment that game engine does not just mean 3D look at this. +1 for a very thorough and thoughtful answer! Great answer marked this one as accepted. Thanks ! wow I did not even know you could change the accepted answer after the fact.  I think the primary benefit of using OpenGL over DirectX is the portability. DirectX only runs on windows. However this is often not a problem (many games only run on Windows). DirectX also provides other libraries which are useful for games which are unrelated to graphics such as sound and input. I believe there are equivalents which are often used with OpenGL but I don't think they're actually part of OpenGL itself. If you're going to be locking into windows with DirectX and you are willing to/interested in learning C# and managed code I have found XNA to be and extremely easy platform to learn. It allows you to learn most of the concepts without dealing with a lot of the really tricky details of DirectX (or OpenGL). You can still use shader code and have the full power of DirectX but in a much friendlier environment. It would be my recomendation but again you'd have to switch to C# (mind you you can also put that on you're resume). DirectX no longer supports C#: http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/gametechnologiesdirectx101/thread/e9f458e0-65c6-4936-9af4-4276fc92f111. The last version I used with support was 9.0c Huge +1 for XNA given the askers background and future applicability of the technology True you cannot program DirectX directly with C# however XNA is a C# library which uses DirectX underneath. It is not the same as DirectX and is very much in use today version 3.0 just came out recently.  I'm doing some OpenGL work right now (on both Windows and Mac). Compared to my midnight game programming using the Unity3D engine usingOpenGL is a bit like having to chop down your own trees to make a house versus buying the materials. Unity3D runs on everything (Mac PC and iPhone Web player etc) and lets you concentrate on the what makes a game a game. To top it off it's faster than anything I could write. You code for it in C# Java or Boo. I just used Unity to mock up a demo for a client who wants something made in OpenGL so it has it's real world uses also. -Chris PS: The Unity Indie version recently became free.

113464,"Java User Interface Specification Java supplies standard User Interface guidelines for applications built using Java Swing. The basic guidelines are good but I really feel the look and feel is really boring and outdated. Is anyone aware of a publicly available Java User Interface Guide that has better look & feel guidelines than the Sun provided guidelines? the apple developer guide has a human computer interface guide - http://developer.apple.com/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AppleHIGuidelines/XHIGIntro/chapter_1_section_1.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000894-TP6 . Even though its targeted at the mac platform you could learn something from it - its the reason why so many mac apps are pleasant to use as well as aesthetically pleasing!  Along the line of Chii's answer I would recommend taking a look at the Windows Vista User Experience Guidelines for general tips on making user interfaces. Although the name (""Windows Vista User Experience Guidelines"") and source (Microsoft) may suggest that it only contains Windows-centric tips and advice it does offer good general tips and directions that can be used when designing interfaces for non-Windows applications as well. The Design Principles sections address some points to keep in mind when designing an effective user interface. For example bullet three of How to Design a Great User Experience says: Don't be all things to all people Your program is going to be more successful by delighting its target users than attempting to satisfy everyone. These are the kinds of tips that apply to designing user interfaces on any platform. Of course there are also Windows-specific guidelines as well. I believe one of the biggest reasons why look and feel of Swing applications seems ""boring"" and ""outdated"" is due to the platform-independent nature of Java. In order for the graphical user interfaces to work on several different platforms Java needs to have facilities to adapt the user interface to the different host operating systems. For example various platforms have various sizes for windows buttons and other visual components so absolute positioning does not work too well. To combat that problem Swing uses Layout Managers which (generally) use relative positioning to place the visual components on the screen. Despite these ""limitations"" of building graphical user interfaces for Java I think that using tips from guidelines that are provided by non-Sun sources and non-Java-specific sources can still be a good source of information in designing and implementing an user interface that is effective. After all designing an user interface is less about programming languages and more about human-machine interaction.  I don't think there are any other complete guidelines. But if you are not talking about the spacing/positioning of components (I don't think that part of Look And Feel Design Guidelines is outdated) but only about the look and feel good starting points are singlabx / swingx: http://swinglabs.org http://swinglabs.org/docs/presentations/2007/DesktopMatters/FilthyRichClients.pdf http://parleys.com/display/PARLEYS/Home#slide=1;talk=7643;title=Filthy%20Rich%20Clients and JGoodies: http://www.jgoodies.com/articles/index.html http://www.jgoodies.com/articles/efficient%20swing%20design.pdf  You have many LNF (Look And Feel) displayed here but they have not exactly a 'Java User Guide' Provided. However MigLayout does follow closely the main User Interface standards that exist out there (including some obcure points of button order): For instance the OK and Cancel buttons have different order on Windows and Mac OS X. While other layout managers use factories and button builders for this it is inherently supported by MigLayout by just tagging the buttons.

1799070,"What might cause OpenGL to behave differently under the ""Start Debugging"" versus ""Start without debugging"" options? I have written a 3D-Stereo OpenGL program in C++. I keep track of the position objects in my display should have using timeGetTime after a timeBeginPeriod(1). When I run the program with ""Start Debugging"" my objects move smoothly across the display (as they should). When I run the program with ""Start without debugging"" the objects occationally freeze for several screen refreshes then jump to a new position. Any ideas as to what may be causing this problem and how to fix it? Edit: It seems like the jerkiness can be resolved after a short delay when I run through ""Start without debugging"" if I click the mouse button. My application is a console application (I take in some parameters when the program first starts). Might there be a difference in window focus between these two options? Is there an explicit way to force the focus to the OpenGL window (in full screen through glutFullScreen();) when I'm done taking input from the console window? Thanks. How does your release build perform and what is your overall CPU usage like? Since I work almost entirely in a development enviroment and CPU usage shouldn't be an issue with the simple displays I render I've never built a release build. My recent attempt to do so was thwarted by a screen capture library that I have been using that refuses to link correctly. CPU utilazation on the core running the process is high but seldom pegged. The most common thing that causes any program to behave differently while being debugged and not being debugged is using uninitialized variables and especially reading uninitialized memory. Check that you're not doing that. Something more OpenGL specific - You might have some problems with flushing of commands. Try inserting glFinish() after drawing every frame. It might also be helpful to somehow really make sure that when the freeze occurs there are actually frames being rendered and not that the whole application is frozen. If there are its more likely that you have some bug in the logic since it seems that OpenGL does its job. Thank you for the advice. Any suggestion on how to determine whether frames are still being rendered during the apparent freeze? I had tried to check that before but found that the slow down due to writing a file was obscuring whatever it was that was going on. As this is a stereo display @ 120Hz I have about 8.33ms to get through my entire display loop. Usually a debug build will initialize memory in exactly the same way whether run through a debugger or not. On windows you would still be using the debug runtime libraries. It can make a big difference when moving to a release build.  The timeGetTime API only has a precision of something like 10ms. If the intervals you're measuring are less than 50ms or so you may simply be seeing the effects of the expected variance in the system timer. I have no idea why the debugger would have an effect on this but then the whole workings of the system are a black box. You could use the QueryPerformanceCounter to get higher-resolution timings which may help. Thanks I'll take a look at that. I had thought that timeBeginPeriod(1) was accurately setting the resolution down to 1ms. If the resolution is @ 10ms that could definately cause some problems for my code. @drknexus The documentation for timeGetTime and timeBeginPeriod implies that it's 1ms but it seems to be highly dependent on what hardware is available. I suppose it's possible that ""modern"" hardware has fixed this it's been a few years since I played with it. This is where I remember the 10ms value from but it's also a few years old: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/172338",c++ windows opengl timer stereo-3d,0.37613244504700466,0.623137651227607,3.8455546239136144E-4,3.4534826299695303E-4
1730600,"Principal component analysis in Python I'd like to use principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. Does numpy or scipy already have it or do I have to roll my own using numpy.linalg.eigh? I don't just want to use singular value decomposition (SVD) because my input data are quite high-dimensional (~460 dimensions) so I think SVD will be slower than computing the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. I was hoping to find a premade debugged implementation that already makes the right decisions for when to use which method and which maybe does other optimizations that I don't know about. Here is another implementation of a PCA module for python using numpy scipy and C-extensions. The module carries out PCA using either a SVD or the NIPALS (Nonlinear Iterative Partial Least Squares) algorithm which is implemented in C.  You do not need full Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) at it computes all eigenvalues and eigenvectors and can be prohibitive for large matrices. scipy and its sparse module provide generic linear algrebra functions working on both sparse and dense matrices among which there is the eig* family of functions : http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/sparse.linalg.html#matrix-factorizations Scikit-learn provides a Python PCA implementation which only support dense matrices for now. Timings : In [1]: A = np.random.randn(1000 1000) In [2]: %timeit scipy.sparse.linalg.eigsh(A) 1 loops best of 3: 802 ms per loop In [3]: %timeit np.linalg.svd(A) 1 loops best of 3: 5.91 s per loop Ah now I see that that the relative speed of the sparse vs nonsparse methods depends on the size of the matrix. If I use your example where A is a 1000*1000 matrix then `eigsh` and `svds` are faster than `eigh` and `svd` by a factor of ~3 but if A is smaller say 100*100 then `eigh` and `svd` are quicker by factors of ~4 and ~1.5 respectively. T would still use sparse SVD over sparse eigenvalue decomposition though. Indeed I think I am biased toward large matrices. To me large matrices are more like 10�_ * 10�_ than 1000 * 1000. In those case you often can't even store the covariance matrices ... You don't need to compute sparse matrices from dense matrices. The algorithms provided in the sparse.linalg module rely only on the matrice vector multiplication operation through the matvec method of the Operator object. For dense matrices this is just something like matvec=dot(A x). For the same reason you don't need to compute the covariance matrix but only to provide the operation dot(A.T dot(A x)) for A. Not really a fair comparison since you still need to compute the covariance matrix. Also it's probably only worth using the sparse linalg stuff for very large matrices since it seems to be quite slow to construct sparse matrices from dense matrices. for example `eigsh` is actually ~4x slower than `eigh` for nonsparse matrices. The same is true for `scipy.sparse.linalg.svds` versus `numpy.linalg.svd`. I would always go with SVD over eigenvalue decomposition for the reasons that @dwf mentioned and perhaps use sparse version of SVD if the matrices get really huge.  You can use sklearn: import sklearn.decomposition as deco import numpy as np x = (x - np.mean(x 0)) / np.std(x 0) # You need to normalize your data first pca = deco.PCA(n_components) # n_components is the components number after reduction x_r = pca.fit(x).transform(x) print ('explained variance (first %d components): %.2f'%(n_components sum(pca.explained_variance_ratio_))) Upvoted because this works nicely for me - I have more than 460 dimensions and even though sklearn uses SVD and the question requested non-SVD I think 460 dimensions is likely to be OK.  PCA using scipy.linalg.svd is super easy. Here's a simple demo: import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from scipy.linalg import svd from scipy.misc import lena # the underlying signal is a sinusoidally modulated image img = lena() t = np.arange(100) time = np.sin(0.1*t) real = time[:np.newaxisnp.newaxis] * img[np.newaxis...] # we add some noise noisy = real + np.random.randn(*real.shape)*255 # (observations features) matrix M = noisy.reshape(noisy.shape[0]-1) # singular value decomposition factorises your data matrix such that: # # M = U*S*V.T (where '*' is matrix multiplication) # # * U and V are the singular matrices containing orthogonal vectors of # unit length in their rows and columns respectively. # # * S is a diagonal matrix containing the singular values of M - these # values squared divided by the number of observations will give the # variance explained by each PC. # # * if M is considered to be an (observations features) matrix the PCs # themselves would correspond to the rows of S^(1/2)*V.T. if M is # (features observations) then the PCs would be the columns of # U*S^(1/2). # # * since U and V both contain orthonormal vectors U*V.T is equivalent # to a whitened version of M. U s Vt = svd(M full_matrices=False) V = Vt.T # sort the PCs by descending order of the singular values (i.e. by the # proportion of total variance they explain) ind = np.argsort(s)[::-1] U = U[: ind] s = s[ind] V = V[: ind] # if we use all of the PCs we can reconstruct the noisy signal perfectly S = np.diag(s) Mhat = np.dot(U np.dot(S V.T)) print ""Using all PCs MSE = %.6G"" %(np.mean((M - Mhat)**2)) # if we use only the first 20 PCs the reconstruction is less accurate Mhat2 = np.dot(U[: :20] np.dot(S[:20 :20] V[::20].T)) print ""Using first 20 PCs MSE = %.6G"" %(np.mean((M - Mhat2)**2)) fig [ax1 ax2 ax3] = plt.subplots(1 3) ax1.imshow(img) ax1.set_title('true image') ax2.imshow(noisy.mean(0)) ax2.set_title('mean of noisy images') ax3.imshow((s[0]**(1./2) * V[:0]).reshape(img.shape)) ax3.set_title('first spatial PC') plt.show()  SVD should work fine with 460 dimensions. It takes about 7 seconds on my Atom netbook. The eig() method takes more time (as it should it uses more floating point operations) and will almost always be less accurate. If you have less than 460 examples then what you want to do is diagonalize the scatter matrix (x - datamean)^T(x - mean) assuming your data points are columns and then left-multiplying by (x - datamean). That might be faster in the case where you have more dimensions than data. can you describe more in detail this trick when you have more dimensions than data? Basically you assume that the eigenvectors are linear combinations of the data vectors. See Sirovich (1987). ""Turbulence and the dynamics of coherent structures.""  You can quite easily ""roll"" your own using scipy.linalg (assuming a pre-centered dataset data): covmat = data.dot(data.T) evs evmat = scipy.linalg.eig(covmat) Then evs are your eigenvalues and evmat is your projection matrix. If you want to keep d dimensions use the first d eigenvalues and first d eigenvectors. Given that scipy.linalg has the decomposition and numpy the matrix multiplications what else do you need? cov matrix is np.dot(data.Tdataout=covmat) where data must be centered matrix.

If not can you post an alternative solution in which the out would be that image. IM having some difficulties in converting this code to c++ because I'm new in python :) oh thats fine.Still thank you so much for this code :)  You might have a look at MDP. I have not had the chance to test it myself but I've bookmarked it exactly for the PCA functionality. +1 great extension!  matplotlib.mlab has a PCA implementation. the link for [PCA of matplotlib](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/api/mlab_api.html#matplotlib.mlab.PCA) is updated. The matplotlib.mlab implementation of PCA uses SVD. Here's [a more detailed description](http://www.clear.rice.edu/comp130/12spring/pca/pca_docs.shtml) of the its functions and how to use.  I just finish reading the book Machine Learning: An Algorithmic Perspective. All code examples in the book was written by Python(and almost with Numpy). The code snippet of chatper10.2 Principal Components Analysis maybe worth a reading. It use numpy.linalg.eig. By the way I think SVD can handle 460 * 460 dimensions very well. I have calculate a 6500*6500 SVD with numpy/scipy.linalg.svd on a very old PC:Pentium III 733mHz. To be honest the script needs a lot of memory(about 1.xG) and a lot of time(about 30 minutes) to get the SVD result. But I think 460*460 on a modern PC will not be a big problem unless u need do SVD a huge number of times. You should never use eig() on a covariance matrix when you can simply use svd(). Depending on how many components you plan on using and the size of your data matrix the numerical error introduced by the former (it does more floating point operations) can become significant. For the same reason you should never explicitly invert a matrix with inv() if what you're really interested in is the inverse times a vector or matrix; you should use solve() instead. @dwf thanks for the info!",python numpy scipy pca,5.8041811244157065E-5,9.465538025160698E-5,8.090869482225979E-5,0.999766394113682

I've tried PNG GIF & TGA. I'd would like to be able to load PNGs. I hope the source code given in the question above will be enough if not then let me know. For a better description of what happens when I attempt to load some other format -- One of the images I was attempting was a 128*128 orange triangle. Depending on the format it would either make the entire 128*128 square orange or make the transparent parts of the image white. OK I'm new at OpenGL + SDL but here is what I have..

Turns out when I was loading the image ( I used my own function instead of IMG_Load() ) it was discarding the alpha layer as it was converting the BPPs. So thanks a lot for your code.  Make sure that you have alpha blending enabled with glEnable(GL_BLEND); glBlendFunc(GL_SRC_ALPHA GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA); otherwise primitives will draw solid colors where there should be transparency. You may need a different blendfunc. This is a common setup. I have that code in my previous question linked in the first post. Actually you have: glBlendFunc(GL_ONE GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA); // notice the GL_ONE instead of GL_SRC_ALPHA - this can make a difference depending on what you are seeing Sorry if you had the code already I wasn't able to scroll the code block on an iPhone. As Jim was saying the blendfunc that you have may not be correct. The blendfunc you're using is for blending a texture with pre-multiplied alpha. Ah well I tried your code then and now it just won't draw it at all :( Try to load in an image that has a known amount of transparency then look at the loaded buffer in the debugger to make sure that the alpha value contains the transparency you expect. If you don't see anything at all I suspect that the alpha could be 0.  I'm not familiar with SDL but since it's SDL that loading the image I would look closer at their docs. I use .png in my own work along with OpenGL and transparency works with no problem. (I use a .png parser called LightZPng.) Also I just noticed your linked post has: glBlendFunc(GL_ONE GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA); instead of: glBlendFunc(GL_SRC_ALPHA GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA); This would have the affect of adding the pixels that should be transparent to whatever is in the background (assuming the alpha is 0 in those texels). Changing that makes the image not appear at all. Even with the TIF now Huh could it be that alpha is simply 0 for all your texels? I would look at your image data before passing it to glTexImage2D to confirm what the alpha values are for some texels. If they are simply RGB images (no alpha at all) then be sure to do a glColor4ub(255 255 255 255) before rendering to be sure your alpha is effectively set to fully opaque.",c++ gui opengl sdl,0.9994113244292347,2.244801661228361E-4,1.9187918537968558E-4,1.7231621926281943E-4
370259,"Java GUI Swing Model Explanation I've been working with Java GUI for a while now but the whole model/structure of JFrames paint() super etc is all murky in my mind. I need a clear explanation or link that will explain how the whole GUI system is organized. Thanks everyone some more answers would be better but this is great! I've found that simply browsing around in the source code (ctrl-click on a name if you're using NetBeans) has been really helpful. If I see a method appear in the completion dialog that I'm not familiar with I'll just click ""Go to source"" and look around until I'm comfortable with it.  If after reading the Swing tutorial you find your interest lies in more advanced topics you may also wish to look at Swing Second Edition by Robinson and Vorobiev.  The same happened to me. Actually to this day I don't quite get 100% how all it works. Swing is a very flexible framework--perhaps too flexible. With flexibility comes a lot of abstraction and with abstraction comes confusion. :) I've found the following articles worth reading. They helped me to better understand the big picture of Swing. http://web.archive.org/web/20110413222135/http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/tsc/articles/architecture/ http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/architecture-142923.html (original links now broken) http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/tsc/articles/architecture/ http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/tsc/articles/architecture/ui_install/index.html They explain quite well how the model and the delegate work. It always drives me mad when I see those JLabel LabelUI ui.update etc. I hope this helps. Very useful link - had not seen that before; bookmarked for a closer look later. Yeahh ... I don't remember how I came to that link. I didn't found it until after several years. I don't know the ""google search"" to produce it either so I have it in my bookmarks too. @OscarRyz links are dead. do you have the copy? i need those for my students. thanks. @OscarRyz Cool thanks! @ihsan Unfortunately the site in Oracle has broken images:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/architecture-142923.html Fortunately we have the wayback machine: http://web.archive.org/web/20110413222135/http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/tsc/articles/architecture/  Since this question is tagged with JFrame I'll suggest a few links for understanding how JFrames and other top-level Swing containers work. I also found that Swing was (and still is) quite involved and taking a look at the documentation provided by Sun is required every once in a while -- Every time I check I seem to learn something new. First the basics: JFrame class from the Java API Specifications. The Java API Specifications often provide good detailed information about the classes. In this instance you'll notice that there are several links such as How to Make Frames section from The Java Tutorials. Aside from that I'll also recommend looking at the Lesson: Using Swing Components from The Java Tutorials. The lesson provides instructions on how to use the components provided in Swing along with some useful examples. For more specifics parts that I've found confusing when I started with Swing was all the different types of panes such as the ContentPane RootPane GlassPane. The Using Top-Level Containers section provides information and helpful diagrams on the container hierarchy of the top-level containers. The How to Use Root Panes section gets into the details about the Glass Layered and Content Panes with plenty of examples.  Filthy Rich Clients by Chet Haase and Romain Guy is a great book about Java UI. It covers some more advanced stuff too but introduction and few first chapters explain fundamental things well.  I found Swing Explorer to be a precious tool to understand the hierarchy of components (particularly in complex GUIs) and look at properties (alas read-only: we get used to Firebug convenience!). It has an Eclipse plugin.  Have you looked at the Java Swing Tutorial (click here)?

526118,"What is the best way to access data in a normalized database schema? I've got a problem that keeps coming up with normalized databases and was looking for the best solution. Suppose I've got an album information database. I want to setup the schema in a normalized fashion so I setup two tables - albums which has one listing for each album and songs which lists all songs contained by albums. albums ------ aid name songs ----- aid sid length This setup is good for storing the data in a normalized fashion as an album can contain any number of songs. However accessing the data in an intuitive manner has now become a lot more difficult. A query which only grabs the information on a single album is simple but how do you grab multiple albums at once in a single query? Thus far the best answer I have come up with is grouping by aid and converting the songs information as arrays. For example the result would look something like this: aid sids lengths 1 [1 2] [1:04 5:45] 2 [3 4 5] [3:30 4:30 5:30] When I want to work with the data I have to then parse the sids and lengths which seems a pointless exercise: I'm making the db concatenate a bunch of values just to separate them later. My question: What is the best way to access a database with this sort of schema? Am I stuck with multiple arrays? Should I store the entirety of a song's information in an object and then those songs into a single array instead of having multiple arrays? Or is there a way of adding an arbitrary number of columns to the resultset (sort of an infinite-join) to accommodate N number of songs? I'm open to any ideas on how to best access the data. I'm also concerned about efficiency as these queries will be run often. If it makes any difference I'm using a PostgreSQL db along with a PHP front-end. I wouldn't break your normalisation for that. Leave the tables normailsed and then use the following to query - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/43870/how-to-concatenate-strings-of-a-string-field-in-a-postgresql-group-by-query  I see your point but I have issues with the first query because you end up with a lot of repeated data - the album name is repeated many times. I'm trying to have my cake and eat it too - I want the data to be as compact as possible but that's not realistic without aggregates. Ah I understand your question now. You're asking how best to micro-optimize something that's actually not very expensive for most cases. And the solution you're toying with is actually going to be significantly less efficient than the ""problem"" it's trying to solve. My advice would be to join the tables and return the columns you need. For anything less than 10000 records returned you won't notice any significant wire time penalty for handing back that AlbumName with each Song record. If you notice it performing slowly in the field then optimize it. But keep in mind that a lot of smart people have spent about 50 years of research making the ""join the tables & return what you need"" solution fast. I doubt you'll beat it with your home-rolled string concatenation/de-concatenation strategy. This is an example. The actual Albums table will have approximately 10 columns that I'll want and that's a lot of repeated data. I'm going with two queries instead. Also no need to be condescending. I know that string concat/de-concate would be slow which is why I posted the question. :P You should also know that returning two recordsets will be slow. Certainly not worth it to avoid repeating 10 columns a few hundred times. Sorry if I sounded condescending. This seems to be new ground for you and it's DB 101.  I have difficulty seeing your point. What exactly do you mean by ""how do you grab multiple albums at once in a single query""? What exactly do you have difficulties with? Intuitively I would say: SELECT a.aid album_id a.name album_name s.sid song_id s.name song_name s.length song_length FROM albums a INNER JOIN songs s ON a.aid = s.aid WHERE a.aid IN (1 2 3) and SELECT a.aid album_id a.name album_name COUNT(s.sid) count_songs SUM(s.length) sum_length /* assuming you store an integer seconds value */ FROM /* here not a string containing '3:18' or such */ albums a INNER JOIN songs s ON a.aid = s.aid WHERE a.aid IN (1 2 3) GROUP BY a.aid Depending on what you want to know/display. Either you query the database for aggregate information or you calculate it yourself out of the query result #1 in your app. Depending on how much data is cached in your app and how long queries take the one strategy can be faster than the other. I would recommend querying the DB though. DBs are made for this kind of stuff. I see your point but I have issues with the first query because you end up with a lot of repeated data - the album name is repeated many times. I'm trying to have my cake and eat it too - I want the data to be as compact as possible but that's not realistic without aggregates. Leave off the album name from the first query. You have it in the second one (which probably comes first anyway) and your app can store some context as well. Other than that I see your point as well. But I guess the repeated album name won't clog your performance too badly. ;-) (Funnily enough I rephrased my second paragraph before posting to avoid the ""you can't have your cake and eat it too"" platitude :-D)  I agree with Jason Kester insofar as I think this is unlikely to really be a performance bottleneck in practice even if you have 10 columns with repeated data. However if you're bent on cutting out that repeated data then I'll suggest using 2 queries: Query #1: SELECT sid length -- And whatever other per-song fields you want FROM songs ORDER BY aid Query #2: SELECT aid a.name COUNT(*) FROM albums a JOIN songs s USING (aid) GROUP BY aid a.name ORDER BY aid a.name The second query enables you to break up the output of the first query into segments appropriately. Note that this will only work reliably if you can assume that no changes will be made to the table between these two queries -- otherwise you'll need a transaction with SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE. Again the mere fact that you're using two separate queries is likely to make this slower overall as in most cases the doubled network latency + query parsing + query planning is likely to swamp the effective increase in network throughput. But at least you won't have that nasty horrible feeling of sending repeated data... :)  SELECT aidGROUP_CONCAT(sid) FROM songs GROUP BY aid; +----+-------------------------+ |aid | GROUP_CONCAT(sid) | +----+-------------------------+ | 3 | 567 | +----+-------------------------+ Yes that's true. I didn't notice the PostgreSQL part of the question. My googling suggests that GROUP_CONCAT() is not supplied by PostgreSQL. However you can build it yourself using CREATE AGGREGATE.  The join queries will ask the database to put the tables together matching the ids and return a single table.

766167,What happens to pixels after passing them into glTexImage2D()? If for example I create an array of pixels like so: int *getPixels() { int *pixels = new int[10]; pixels[0] = 1; pixels[1] = 0; pixels[1] = 1; // etc... } glTexImage2D(... getPixels()); Does glTexImage2D use that reference or copy the pixels into it's own memory? If the answer is the former then should I do the following? int *p = getPixels(); glTexImage2D(... p); /* Just changed to delete[] because delete * would only delete the first element! */ delete[] p; I think you would need to call glDeleteTextures() after you have finished drawing your pixels to free the memory.  From this quote in the man page it sounds like glTexImage2D allocates its own memory. This would make sense ideally the OpenGL API would send data to be stored on the graphics card itself (if drivers/implementation/etc permitted). In GL version 1.1 or greater pixels may be a null pointer. In this case texture memory is allocated to accommodate a texture of width width and height height. You can then download subtextures to initialize this texture memory. The image is undefined if the user tries to apply an uninitialized portion of the texture image to a primitive. So yea I'd imagine there is no harm in freeing the memory once you've generated your texture. I'm not sure if that's the case on PC but on consoles texture uploading functions very often simply store pointer to texture and schedule DMA transfer for later time so you can't free memory as soon the function returned.  Yes after the call to geTexImage2D() returns it is safe to discard the data you passed to it. infact if you don't do that you'll have a memory leak like in this code: int *getPixels() { int *pixels = new int[10]; pixels[0] = 1; pixels[1] = 0; pixels[1] = 1; // etc... } glTexImage2D(... getPixels()); You pass the pointer to the buffer to the call but then the pointer is lost and most likely leaks. What you should do is store it and delete it aftet the call retuns: int *pbuf = getPixels(); glTexImage2D(... pbuf); delete[] pbuf; alternativly if the texture is of a constant size you can pass a pointer to an array that is on the stack: { int buf[10]; ... glTexImage2D(... pbuf); } Finally if you don't want to worry about pointers and arrays you can use STL: vector<int> buf; fillPixels(buf); getTexImage2D(... buf.begin()); Oops! My initial snippet used delete instead of delete[] for deleting the pixel buffer. technically buf.begin() might not work but &buf[0] is guaranteed to work. In most STL implementations the vector iterator is a pointer but it doesn't have to be. actually delete[] is what you should be using. my bad fixed now. btw this is exactly why you should use STL :),c++ opengl glteximage2d,0.9180804166850078,4.973206268009736E-4,0.06863813661955755,0.01278412606863357
665688,"Is stereoscopy (3D stereo) making a come back? I'm working on a stereoscopy application in C++ and OpenGL (for medical image visualization). From what I understand the technology was quite big news about 10 years ago but it seems to have died down since. Now many companies seem to be investing in the technology... Including nVidia it would seem. Stereoscopy is also known as ""3D Stereo"" primarily by nVidia (I think). Does anyone see stereoscopy as a major technology in terms of how we visualize things? I'm talking in both a recreational and professional capacity. With nVidia's 3D kit you don't need to ""make a stereoscopy application"" drivers and video card take care of that. 10 years ago there was good quality stereoscopy with polarized glasses and extremely expensive monitors and low quality stereoscopy with red/cyan glasses. What you have now is both cheap and good quality. Right now all you need is 120Hz LCD entry level graphics card and $100 shutter glasses. So no doubt about it it will be the next big thing. At least in entertainment. I'm struggling to find a 120Hz LCD... Could someone name a few brands or models? Ones explicitly named by Nvidia: Samsung SyncMaster 2233RZ and ViewSonic FuHzion VX2265wm. I'm sure there are more. It's a bit hard to find them though as refresh Hz it's not something that's important LCD spec so most don't even specify this. Ah interesting. I was under the impression that 120Hz LCDs weren't available - perhaps I've been living in the past with the CRT sitting on my desk. Could you point me in the right direction? For example Nvidia bundles it's kit with Samsung SyncMaster 2233RZ. Sony sales 200Hz LCD Bravia Z since last year. 120Hz LCD is pretty much standard now. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_interpolation BTW. You're serious about having CRT on your desk? Wow! Haha yes I'd read in so many places that LCD doesn't support over 80Hz and I believed it since that appeared to be common knowledge; I guess all the material I read must have been ancient and defunct. As a result of this I bought a CRT. Now I feel a little embarrassed! I bought it about 2 years ago mind. Since when has >80Hz been around? Well it was true about 2 years ago. The thing is that fast LCD are TN which don't give you colors as rich as IPS or VA. BTW. most entry level LCD still are 60Hz although as long as you don't need stereoscopy it doesn't really mater. @Zeus one for each eye perfect for stereoscopy ;-) @vartec - I have 2 crt's on my desk :(  Enthusiasm for stereo display seems to come and go in cycles of hype and disappointment (e.g cinema). I don't expect TV and PCs will be any different. For medical visualisation if it was that useful there would be armies of clinicians sitting in front of expensive displays wearing shutter glasses already. Big hint: there aren't. And that market doesn't need 3D display tech to reach ""impulse purchase"" pricing levels as an enabler. You make a very good point. Actually in the medical field stereo 3D is quickly gaining popularity and is actively being used in multiple practices including robotics and surgery. For example with the DaVinci robot surgeons perform cases every day using a 3D display to operate with and the technicians moving tools in and out of the robot/person's body (using a monitor) don't want to push anything too far into the patient and stab them. Normally the robot would prevent you from doing this but it tends to malfunction and people just turn it off. So the need for depth perception is very important.  One reason why it is probably coming back is due to the fact that we know have screens with high enough refreshrate so that 3D is possible. I think I read that you will need somewhere around 100Hz for 3D-TV. So no need for bulky glasses anymore. Edit: To reiterate: You no longer need glasses in order to have 3D TV. This article was posted in a swedish magazine a few weeks ago: http://www.nyteknik.se/nyheter/it_telekom/tv/article510136.ece. What it says is basically that instead of glasses you use a technique with vertical lenses on the screen. Problem with CRT is that they are not flat. Our more modern flat screens obviously hasn't got this problem. The second problem is that you need high frequency (at least 100 Hz as that makes the eye get 50 frames per second) and a lot of pixels since each eye only gets half the pixels. TV sets that support 3D without glasses have been sold by various companies since 2005. It seems to me that 3D TVs are still quite rare I remember when Sharp tried this but I haven't really seen that product recently (I think they stopped marketing it) - I think Zalman do one right? Who else does them? What's the marketing keyword used most ""3D TV""? Zalman does ones that use polarization the 120Hz thing is based shutter glasses. The 3D-without-glasses displays are technically known as ""autosteroscopic"".

1759397,"the quake 2 md2 file format (theory) i am trying to load md2 files in opengl but i noticed that most example programs just use a precompiled list of normals. something like this..... //table of precalculated normals { -0.525731f 0.000000f 0.850651f } { -0.442863f 0.238856f 0.864188f } { -0.295242f 0.000000f 0.955423f } { -0.309017f 0.500000f 0.809017f } ... ... Ok this may sound abit dumb but i thought each model is made of different triangles how then is it possible that you can use one set of precompiled normals to render all models? It seems abit strange and any ideas will be appreciated. You could use a precompiled table of normals and use a lookup table to select one that is 'good enough' for a particular case. Each triangle is on a distinct plane and it's that plane that has a normal not the triangle itself. For instance lets imagine we have a point. Expand that point into a sphere for the purposes of this discussion makes it a little easier to grasp conceptually. If you draw a perfect circle around that sphere on the y axis then rotate that circle in the x axis 1 degree each time you'll end up with 360 circles. If you take a normal at 1 degree intervals along each of those circles you'll end up with 360 ** 2 points. From there your normal is the vector from the center of the sphere to that point on the sphere and it is a normal for a plane constructed tangential to point on the sphere. What you end up with if you calculate these two for every point on that sphere is a precalculated table of normals which will almost certainly be good enough for most situations. Now you just need to design a lookup scheme for that data (plane -> normal). Do you happen to have any literature i can go through on this? No sorry this is just off the top of my head and my understanding of the math involved. Most higher level math books that cover 3d geometry should probably cover it though. +1. That's what I've heard. The table covers a finite subset of the unit sphere. So instead of storing normals in .md2 you would store indices to save space (That's what vector quantization is about).  It's been answered already but I want to shed some more light on it. The table contains vectors that cover the unit sphere's surface pretty uniformly. It seems the set of 162 vectors are the corners of a subdivided icosahedron. This is done to lossily compress 3D vectors of unit length to an index (8 bits) see vector quantization. For storing an arbitrary normal vector you can search the table for the closest match and store the index of this match instead. With this table of 162 well distributed vectors the angle between the original vector and the approximated one is expected to be below 11�� which seems to be good enough for the Quake2 engine.  The MD2 file format specifies that each vertex has a ""normal index"" and this is a lookup into a well-known table of normals. I would assume that these normals are distributed around a sphere. Presumably the tool that built the model chose the most appropriate of these normals for each vertex. With regard to the first answer: if you want a very faceted model (like a cube) then each polygon does indeed have its own normal and each of the vertices that makes up that polygon should use the same normal vector. However if you want smooth shading (such as a torso) it's common for each vertex in a polygon to have a different normal vector. This allows the lighting to vary across the polygon which is useful in both per-vertex and per-pixel lighting scenarios. Though you will use the polygon plane normal for lighting if you are drawing flat-shaded polygons. If you are talking about vertex normals then you still aren't talking about the polygon itself having a normal. You are still talking about a plane having a normal and that plane is usually taken to be a plane constructed perpendicular to the intended curvature of the shape at the point that the vertex occurs. I was just trying to clarify the point that I think you were making in your first paragraph. When it comes to MD2 models I think it's more useful to consider the tangent plane at each vertex rather than the tangent plane for each triangle (which is the way I read your answer at first). From your comment on my answer I think we're on the same page. I've done enough graphics work to be dangerous but not enough to know all that much. I just happen to be strong enough in the maths to figure out what's going on. The first paragraph was an attempt to answer the question as I percieved it was asked. As an aside the normals of the plane the polygon itself is on isn't useless it's just not used in lighting (it might be used ie in a physics engine though or collision detection or...).",c++ c opengl,0.813746698045664,3.6245979849219146E-4,0.18561260954763745,2.782326082062894E-4
1564870,"Recommended OpenGL / GLUT Reference What OpenGL / GLUT reference is good for day to day programming as you learn? Ideally I'm looking for something with lots of C++ sample code to help me learn as I develop OpenGL applications as well as details about the APIs similar to what MSDN provides for .net programming. If there isn't a one stop shop then please list the set of references I should use and what the strengths of each one is. The PyOpenGL Documentation is identical to the OpenGL docs but far more readable and user-friendly. Have a look. I also second the OpenGL SuperBible.  I learned OpenGL using the OpenGL Super Bible. It's still the best reference for it that I can find.  The Red Book is the standard book on OpenGL. Don't be discouraged by the fact that the Amazon review for the 7th Edition has only two stars; this is because people are disappointed that there isn't more on the newest OpenGL features in the book. Previous editions got more stars. Another good book is the OpenGL SuperBible. The NeHe Tutorials are one of the most often cited OpenGL tutorials with sample code not only in C++ but in many other programming languages.  I think that by ""Glut"" you mean ""Freeglut"". In this case you should use this specific reference: http://jocelyn.frechot.free.fr/freeglut/freeglut_2.6.0-api_0.3.xhtml It contains latest references for current Freeglut. This way you can use special aptitudes of Freeglut (like controlling your own GL loop with glutMainLoopEvent() which is invaluadble when you're using Freeglut with others libraries.  For all the details about the OpenGL-API there are of course the sdk documentation pages https://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/ or you could look into the standard specification itself (which I personally avoid most of the time). This most likely only helps if you already have a basic understanding of how to use the GL. The news section on opengl.org also often links to tutorials and books. Just skimmed through it and found this tutorial. As for OpenGL related books I only know the Super Bible which I think is okay to get started. When learning OpenGL without any computer graphics knowledge a book on that topic can be very helpful too. A classic would be Coumputer Graphics Principal and Practice by James D.

1589706,"Iterating over arbitrary dimension of numpy.array Is there function to get an iterator over an arbitrary dimension of a numpy array? Iterating over the first dimension is easy...

For example the last dimension: In [73]: for r in c.swapaxes(20).swapaxes(12) : ....: print r ....: [[ 0 4 8] [12 16 20]] [[ 1 5 9] [13 17 21]] [[ 2 6 10] [14 18 22]] [[ 3 7 11] [15 19 23]] I'm making a generator to do this myself but I'm surprised there isn't a function named something like numpy.ndarray.iterdim(axis=0) to do this automatically. I'd use the following: c = numpy.arange(2 * 3 * 4) c.shape = (2 3 4) for r in numpy.rollaxis(c 2): print(r) The function rollaxis creates a new view on the array. In this case it's moving axis 2 to the front equivalent to the operation c.transpose(2 0 1). +1: Quite direct but unfortunately a tad slower than the simple `c[::i]` approach (not sure why).  There is special Ellipsis object in python which can be passed to __getitem__ or written as ... in slice operations: >>> c[... ... 0] array([[ 0 4 8] [12 16 20]]) @Denis: The ellipsis is less appropriate here than "":"": the ellipsis is intended to represent any number of "":"". Your `c[......0]` would thus be better written as `c[...0]`.  I guess there is no function. When I wrote my function I ended up taking the iteration EOL also suggested. For future readers here it is: def iterdim(a axis=0) : a = numpy.asarray(a); leading_indices = (slice(None))*axis for i in xrange(a.shape[axis]) : yield a[leading_indices+(i)]  What you propose is quite fast but the legibility can be improved with the clearer forms: for i in range(c.shape[-1]): print c[::i] or better (faster and more explicit): for i in range(c.shape[-1]): print c[...i] However the first approach above appears to be about twice as slow as the swapaxes() approach: python -m timeit -s 'import numpy; c = numpy.arange(24).reshape(234)' 'for r in c.swapaxes(20).swapaxes(12): u = r' 100000 loops best of 3: 3.69 usec per loop python -m timeit -s 'import numpy; c = numpy.arange(24).reshape(234)' 'for i in range(c.shape[2]): u = c[::i]' 100000 loops best of 3: 6.08 usec per loop python -m timeit -s 'import numpy; c = numpy.arange(24).reshape(234)' 'for r in numpy.rollaxis(c 2): u = r' 100000 loops best of 3: 6.46 usec per loop I would guess that this is because swapaxes() does not copy any data and because the handling of c[::i] might be done through general code (that handles the case where : is replaced by a more complicated slice). Note however that the more explicit second solution c[...i] is both quite legible and quite fast: python -m timeit -s 'import numpy; c = numpy.arange(24).reshape(234)' 'for i in range(c.shape[2]): u = c[...i]' 100000 loops best of 3: 4.74 usec per loop  So one can iterate over the first dimension easily as you've shown. Another way to do this for arbitrary dimension is to use numpy.rollaxis() to bring the given dimension to the first (the default behavior) and then use the returned array (which is a view so this is fast) as an iterator. In [1]: array = numpy.arange(24).reshape(234) In [2]: for array_slice in np.rollaxis(array 1): ....: print array_slice.shape ....: (2 4) (2 4) (2 4) EDIT: I'll comment that I submitted a PR to numpy to address this here: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/3262.

3151941,Tricky SQL for a smart search I am using a form through a PHP CMS system that defines custom fields and such. One of the custom fields allows for an input field which does a smart search. What this means is that when you start typing it shows the records that match quite similar to google suggest. The smartsearch input field relies on a stored mysql search and this is what I am having trouble with because it just looks too complex. I am going to paste the SQl from an existing search and then explain what I am trying to do. There are different sql queries in a few columns as follows: fromclause ((`clients` INNER JOIN `addresstorecord` ON `clients`.`uuid` = `addresstorecord`.`recordid` AND `addresstorecord`.`tabledefid`='tbld:6d290174-8b73-e199-fe6c-bcf3d4b61083' AND addresstorecord.primary='1') INNER JOIN `addresses` ON `addresstorecord`.`addressid` = `addresses`.`uuid`) displayfield: IF(clients.company != '' CONCAT(clients.company IF(clients.lastname != '' OR clients.firstname != '' CONCAT(' (' IF(clients.lastname != '' clients.lastname '{blank}') ' ' IF(clients.firstname != '' clients.firstname '{blank}') ')') '') ) IF(clients.lastname != '' OR clients.firstname != '' CONCAT(IF(clients.lastname != '' clients.lastname '{blank}') ' ' IF(clients.firstname != '' clients.firstname '{blank}')) '')) ) secondaryfield: IF(addresses.city != '' OR addresses.state !='' OR addresses.postalcode != '' CONCAT(IF(addresses.city != '' addresses.city '') ' ' IF(addresses.state != '' addresses.state '') ' ' IF(addresses.postalcode != '' addresses.postalcode '')) 'unspecified location') classfield clients.type searchfields clients.company clients.firstname clients.lastname filterclause clients.inactive=0 I am having trouble understanding how these queries actually work. displayfield and secondaryfield in particular seem very redundant. i don��t think my needs are so different from how the current example smartsearch field works...just instead of clients i want guests and instead of address i just want it to match firstname lastname or passport number. I wonder if I even need secondaryfield in that case? In particular the inner join in the fromclause confuses me as I don��t think I need to do that as all the guest information is in one table... Any assistance here is much appreciated thankyou. how would I do that? I don��t think I can...I think the smartsearch field does different queries depending on what is typed.... could you provide the entire query as a block so we can see what's actually being queried from the DB? I reformatted your code samples with some indenting so it's easier to read. They were very long and scrolling horizontally it's hard to tell what's going on. Something like this appears to do nothing: IF(addresses.state != '' addresses.state '') I would guess it was written by someone who didn't understand how NULL works in SQL or someone who is accustomed to Oracle where NULL and '' are equivalent. Displayfield and secondaryfield have different content. Displayfield shows the person's company and name whereas secondaryfield shows the person's address state and postal code. These are not redundant. The complexity comes from trying to handle blank or unspecified content. Thankyou for the reformatting. The code definitely does work and was designed to work with MySQL. I think it has something to do with that since it is a smartsearch what I have posted is not the entire query rather the query would be made from part of what I have poested and part of what I type in the field as I type it. Unfortunately I am having trouble finding any documentation and figuring this out and am working somewhat blind. Would you have any suggestions on how I can figure out what queries are actually being made to the database? Can mysql be configured to log all queries? I agree some unecesary complexity could be avoided using `IFNULL(addresses.city ''` instead of `IF(addresses.city != '' addresses.city '')` for example. @Jacob: I think you're right probably the smartsearch system uses and modify these parts of queries to build one based on the answers/choices on the form. this is why there are so many options that seems unecessary. They may be used depending on the choices for the search. To log mysql queries you can insert in `/etc/my.cnf`: `[mysqld]` section: `log=/tmp/mysql.log` mysql needs rights to create and write to the file. Make it only readable to mysql as it will log ALL queries including passwords and to use it only during developing debugging as it will become very big quickly +1 to @laurent-rpnet.

724156,Keyboard input hesitation when held down? Does anyone know why there is some hesitation when you hold down a keyboard key and try to process it? I'm calling a function right in my WinProc(...) that will move an image on the screen (OpenGL) when a key is held down. I press it and get a single response then there is about .5 seconds of nothing then it behaves as normal (moves 1 pixel every WinMain loop). I'm wondering if the Windows messages are being delayed somehow because of some feature I need to disable??? Here's my code: int WINAPI WinMain(HINSTANCE hinstance HINSTANCE hprevinstance LPSTR lpcmdline int nshowcmd) { bool quit = false; MSG msg; createWindow(hinstance SCRW SCRH SCRD WINDOWED); // Main loop while (!quit) { if (PeekMessage(&msg NULL NULL NULL PM_REMOVE)) { if (msg.message == WM_QUIT) quit = true; TranslateMessage(&msg); DispatchMessage(&msg); } renderFrame(); // processes graphics SwapBuffers(hdc); } return msg.lParam; } and WinProc (there were more cases but same thing...):  LRESULT CALLBACK WinProc(HWND hwnd UINT msg WPARAM wparam LPARAM lparam) { switch(msg) { case WM_KEYDOWN: switch ( wparam ) { case VK_RIGHT: key_RIGHT(); return 0; } return 0; } } and key_RIGHT: void key_RIGHT() { MoveObjectRight1Pixel(); } It's a rather standard keyboard setting to have a small delay between when the key was pressed and when repeat messages get generated. Instead of processing keyboard input in your Windows message handler you could instead keep an array of 256 bits indicating the current state of the keyboard. When you receive a WM_KEYDOWN or WM_KEYUP you update the bit of the corresponding key. Then in your main loop you check the current state of the key and the previous state of the key (by keeping a second array of 256 bits that you make a copy to every frame). If the key is currently down but was not down in the previous frame then you move your object accordingly. Another alternative is to use the GetAsyncKeyState() function. I was afraid I would have to do some silly workaround... There's no way to force Windows to send me messages at a civilized rate? That's a huge keyboard. :) Most standard PC keyboards are around 105 keys so 128 bits sounds like plenty to me. @unwind: True most keyboards have a sane number of keys but the virtual keycodes (VK_* constants) range from 0 to 255.  Well I think you're dealing with a standard windows feature here. Windows usually has a delay before it fires the repititive keystrokes events when thekey is suppressed. I don't know about other methods but on the first key press you could activate a timer which would check whether the key is suppressed every few milliseconds and then process your code accordingly. I think that would solve the problem you're having.,c++ windows opengl input messages,0.23385085004837322,0.7186766715869481,4.002736470783001E-4,0.04707220471760022
421381,"Swing buttons don't react immediately! How can I change that? I've built a form with Netbeans's visual editor. When I press one of the buttons it should do the following : set it to disabled perform a task that takes some time when the task finishes the button will be enabled again However the following happens: the button remains in a pressed state until the task finishes when the task finishes the enabling/disabling of buttons will be very fast (they will happen but you won't notice them) This behaviour is not something I want. I tried using repaint on the JButton on the JFrame and even on the JPanel containing the button but I can't seem to get it to do what I want. Some hints? You need to do the task that takes some time in a different thread. The reason the button is blocking is because the work is being done in the same thread that draws the button. Once the work is done the button can do the rest of what you tell it to. If you use a different thread the thread will go do the task while the drawing code can continue drawing the form.  When you do work in a button callback you are stalling the GUI painting thread until it completes. What you need to do is spawn a thread to do the long running task and then have that thread use SwingUtilities.invokeLater() to update the UI when it completes. Not using invokeLater is not thread safe and is generally bad mojo. A basic example is: button.setEnabled(false); new Thread(new Runnable() { public void run() { // Do heavy lifting here SwingUtilies.invokeLater(new Runnable() { public void run() { button.setEnabled(true); } }); } }).start(); The part with ""button.setEnabled(true)"" is taking place in the thread that does the work ? Should I pass the button to the thread ( in case I don't want to use anonymous classes ) ? It's taking place in the GUI Thread. See http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/javax/swing/SwingUtilities.html#invokeLater(java.lang.Runnable) As for how much you dislike anonymous classes that's up to you. You might want to put a try-finally in there too. Also it's more robust to calculate the new button state (in the EDT) rather than firing delayed messages with old state about the place. I forgot the run methods. Thanks Tom. Goes to show you how dependent I am of my IDE :) Sothe answer's yes? :) This answer is lacking in explanation - feel free to copy some of the explanation from my answer. Done. Thanks Paul. Made it community while I was at it. You might as well consider using SwingWorker (part of Java6 but exists as Open Source library for Java5) which will make the source code ligher (threading and EDT issues are handled by SwingWorker itself).  The Concurrency in Swing tutorial from Sun is well worth a read. Excellent explanation and background reading including the event dispatching thread using worker threads etc  When you do things in a button callback you are essentially stalling the gui painting thread - not just for the button but for ANY gui painting. (Try covering the interface with another window and then exposing it again - it won't repaint until the task is finished!) What you need to do is spawn a thread to do the long running task and then have that thread use SwingUtilities.invokeLater() to do the enabling of the button. invokeLater forces the button enable to happen in the gui painting thread. You may want to set a busy cursor or otherwise lock the interface while the long-running thread is operating.

3595976,"Backup MySql database with PHP I have a pretty large db in MySql and I need to take backups of it every day or so. I need to be able to take backups from any computer so therefore I thought about making a php script to do this and put this php script online (offcourse with password protection and authorization etc so that only I can access it). I wonder however how is this done properly? What commands should I use and is it possible to change settings of the backup (for instance Add AUTO_INCREMENT value = true)? I would appreciate examples... Also if this is a bad method (unsafe or maybe gives bad backups with bad sql files) what other method would be preferred? I have shell-access and I have a VPS (ubuntu server). My Mysql version is 5.1 Thanks There's no need to involve PHP in the database backup. You just need a script that uses mysqldump to backup the database and setup a CRON job to periodically execute the script: mysqldump db_name > backup-file.sql ...will backup your database to a file by redirecting the output from the mysqldump to the specified file name. Peter brought up a good point that the command would only give you one day of archiving--any archive over two days old would be overwritten. This would allow you have a rolling log going back seven days: CURRENT_DAY_OF_WEEK=`date '+%u'` FILENAME=""mysqlbackup_""$CURRENT_DAY_OF_WEEK"".sql"" mysqldump db_name > $FILENAME Also be aware that file permissions will apply - can't write a file if the user executing the script doesn't have permissions to the folder. Of course you probably shouldn't over write the same file every day. Maybe tack on the current date to the file name or some such.... @Peter Ajtai: Goood point updated. Don't send a PHP to do a cron mans job  I agree with OMG Ponies mysqldump + script is the way to go. The only other option that I use is to set up a slave server.

784445,"How could simply calling Pitch() and Yaw() cause the camera to eventually Roll()? I'm coding a basic OpenGL game and I've got some code that handles the mouse in terms of moving the camera. I'm using the following method: int windowWidth = 640; int windowHeight = 480; int oldMouseX = -1; int oldMouseY = -1; void mousePassiveHandler(int x int y) { int snapThreshold = 50; if (oldMouseX != -1 && oldMouseY != -1) { cam.yaw((x - oldMouseX)/10.0); cam.pitch((y - oldMouseY)/10.0); oldMouseX = x; oldMouseY = y; if ((fabs(x - (windowWidth / 2)) > snapThreshold) || (fabs(y - (windowHeight / 2)) > snapThreshold)) { oldMouseX = windowWidth / 2; oldMouseY = windowHeight / 2; glutWarpPointer(windowWidth / 2 windowHeight / 2); } } else { oldMouseX = windowWidth / 2; oldMouseY = windowHeight / 2; glutWarpPointer(windowWidth / 2 windowHeight / 2); } glutPostRedisplay(); } However after looking around in circles you'll find the camera starts to ""roll"" (rotate). Since I'm only calling Pitch and Yaw I don't see how this is possible. Here is the code I'm using for my Camera class: http://pastebin.com/m20d2b01e As far as I know my camera ""rolling"" shouldn't happen. It should simply pitch up and down or yaw left and right. NOT roll. What could be causing this? Well if you start off looking forward horizontal to the horizon pitch up 90 degrees then yaw left 90 degrees then pitch down 90 degrees you'd be looking in the same direction as you started but the horizon would be vertical (as if you'd rolled 90 degrees left). Edit: I think the problem is that yaw/pitch/roll would be appropriate if the camera is being treated like an airplane. What you probably want to do is treat it like a point in a sphere keeping track of where on the sphere you are pointing the camera. Instead of yaw/pitch use spherical coordinates keeping track of theta (latitude) and phi (longitude). They may sound similar but consider the extreme case where the camera is pointing directly up. With yaw/pitch you can still freely adjust the yaw and pitch from that straight-up direction. With theta/phi you could only adjust theta downward and no matter how much you adjusted phi decreasing theta would still give you a camera that is parallel to the horizon. This is how FPS camera's work (you can't look so far down that you're looking behind you). Edit 2: Looking at the camera code you linked to you want to be using the rotLati(float angle) and rotLongi(float angle) functions. If I start moving my mouse in tight circles on the screen you'll see a distinct and slow roll. It completely rolls all 360 degrees. It isn't inverting the view. +1 Beat me to it. If you're moving your mouse in tight circles you'll get small amounts of roll. That's just how the combination of movements work. well if you replace the 90's in my answer with 20's the answer would still be the same. moving in circles would do basically what i am describing. Nestor Kip just explained how pitching and yawing can be combined to get the net effect of a roll. His numbers are exaggerated to make the effect easier to see -- hold your hand in front of you and make those motions with it. You're getting smaller motions from your mouse which is why you have to move it around a lot more before you go 360 degrees but it's still the same issue.  You will probably need to use quaternions for composing rotations if you are not doing so already. This avoids the problem of gimbal lock which you can get when orienting a camera by rotation around the 3 axes. Here is how to convert between them. Use quaternions is the answer.  I believe this circumstance is called Gimbal Lock - there's an example of it with illustrations on the wikipedia page.  Mathematically the reason for this is that rotations in 3D space do not commute. What that means is that pitch() followed by yaw() is not the same as yaw() followed by pitch() but a consequence of that fact is that the three kinds of rotations are inextricably linked and you can't perform any two of them without getting some of the third. In other words any sequence of pitch()es and yaw()s will produce a noticeable roll() effect over time unless the second half of the sequence is the exact reverse of the first half. (There's a lot of fairly intricate math involved in this but the details aren't particularly relevant)  Congratulations -- you have discovered Lie group theory! Yes it's possible. The outcome of a series of transformations depends on the order in which they're executed. Doing a pitch followed by a yaw is not the same as a doing a yaw followed by a pitch. In fact in the limit of infinitesimally small yaws and pitches the difference amounts to a pure roll; the general case is a little more complicated. (Physicists call this the ""commutation relationships of the rotational group"".) If you're familiar with rotation matrices you can work it out quite easily. heh looks like we were thinking exactly the same thing ;-)  Pitch/yaw/roll are all relative to your vehicle's orientation. When you pitch up/down you change your axis of yaw. Likewise when you yaw you change your pitch axis. So it's possible to change your orientation in a way similar to a roll maneuver just by a combination and pitch & yaw maneuvers.",c++ opengl camera glut,0.977761507721835,2.871797477300527E-4,2.454729832204115E-4,0.021705839547214594

Is it possible to assign certain controls a different look and feel? Perhaps using some kind of chaining or a proxy look and feel? Here is a library which will automaticaly change the look and feel.

It is almost impossible to mix PLAFs within one application. I have seen a few attempts all failed. It's actually per-AppContext. You should be able to have applets on different sites having different PL&Fs installed.  Swing unfortunately does lots of ""psuedo-global"" things behind the scenes. AFAIK the only way to do it consistently is to use the private AppContext API. Each AppContext has its own event dispatch thread and other ""psuedo-globals"".

In any event the problem is in update_r. You reference vs in the first line of update_r even though vs is not defined in this function. Python is not looking at the vs defined above. Try adding global vs as the first line of update_r or adding vs to the parameter list for update_r  In the first line of update_r you have vsve=update_v(nvsvemsmedtfsfe). Look at the function that you are calling. You are calling update_v with a bunch of parameters. One of these parameters is vs. However that is the first time in that function that vs appears. The variable vs does not have a value associated with it yet. Try initializing it first and your error should disappear there is a global definition of vs. normally it would have been used. the only reason that it's not is the vs in the left hand side of the assignment. that defines an unintialized local variable with the same name. I did intend to convey that but perhaps I should have worded my answer better. Sorry for the miscommunicaton thanks for replayhoweverin my understanding(newb's)is that vs on the left hand side doesnt not really matter if it has the sam name with one of the global variables it is local.please help me with understanding this Okay so you're assigning a local variable called vs to the return value of some computation on the global variable vs. While you and I understand this distinction the Python interpreter does not. When you create the local vs (which is being assigned) then the next call to vs will be to the local vs. So what happens is that the Python interpreter is trying to perform the computation on the local vs (which has no value yet). I would fix it by doing this: temp_vsve=update_v(nvsvemsmedtfsfe) vs = temp_vs This should fix your problem. Also do what foosion says (before the vs init)  On line 39 you do vsve=update_v(nvsvemsmedtfsfe) while you are inside a function. Since you defined a global variable called vs you would expect this to work. It would have worked if you had: vs_newve_new = update_v(nvsvemsmedtfsfe) because then the interpreter knows vs in the function arguments is the global one. But since you had vs in the left hand side you created an uninitialized local variable. But dude you have a much bigger problem in your code: update_r calls update_v update_v calls force and force calls update_r - you will get a stack overflow :) thanks for replay..the thing is how can I solve this bigger problemthat is actually the reason I post thisit does really make me feel badplease help me..",python numpy,2.0814603439923905E-4,0.025735253052979204,2.9014986980384675E-4,0.9737664510428177
1272120,What are the error messages for breaking the GLSL shader instruction limits? We're a small dev team working with some GLSL that may be too large for older graphics cards to compile. We want to display a sensible error message to the user (rather than just dump the info log or output a generic 'this shader didn't work' type of message) when this happens based on the type of error. The question is ATI and nVidia have different conventions for these error messages and the only way I've found to decide what type of error the shader had is to parse the error string generated by glGetShaderInfoLog. Given that is there a listing somewhere or does anyone know what the error output for both ATI and nVidia cards looks like? Or is there a better way to detect when the instruction limit has been exceeded? Even if you know what the error messages look like now nVidia and ATI are under no obligation to keep them the same in the next version(s) of their drivers. They basically can't be relied on for anything except debugging purposes.

1724504,Just curious about result from NumPy function! I have used NumPy for my Master thesis. I've converted parts of the code from MATLAB code but I have doubts in NumPy/Python when I reference: m = numpy.ones((102)) m[:0] which returns: array([ 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1.]) and when I ref to: m[:0:1] it returns: array([[ 1.] [ 1.] [ 1.] [ 1.] [ 1.] [ 1.] [ 1.] [ 1.] [ 1.] [ 1.]]) that I think it should be cause same result with MATLAB!!! It would be very helpful if you'd proofread your question and format it properly. oops  sorry about that :) this should help a bit though I still don't understand the question exactly! thank you very much for formatting Amro :) I'm still learning Python myself but I think the way that slicing works is that indices point to in-between locations therefore 0:1 only gets you the first column. Is this what you were asking about? This is what the documentation has to say: One way to remember how slices work is to think of the indices as pointing between characters with the left edge of the first character numbered 0. Then the right edge of the last character of a string of n characters has index n for example:  +---+---+---+---+---+ | H | e | l | p | A | +---+---+---+---+---+ 0 1 2 3 4 5 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 No m[:0:1] is the equivalent of the matlab statement as shown in the question - this extracts column 0 equivalent to column 1 in Matlab. 0:2 is a slice covering 01 which is both columns (so the whole array in this case) I think this what the OP was trying to do since (aside from the starting index) in MATLAB: `m(:1:2)` gets you two columns while in Python/NumPy: `m[:0:1]` returns one column. I guess this is something to be clarified.. Agree its not clear - I read the question as asking about extracting a column - in matlab m(:1) gives a 2d column vector - the same as m[:0:1] in numpy but m[:0] in numpy gives a 1d array - I think the question was why this is different to matlab but the slices translate as you say... Yea it's not definitely clear in the question. I meant the same as Amro: MATLAB m(:1:2) NumPy m[:0:2]  I forget what numpy does but Matlab indexes vectors from 1 not 0. So array(:0) is an error in Matlab.  This is because numpy has the concept of 1d arrays which Matlab doesn't have. Coupled with numpys broadcasting this provides a powerful simplification (less worrying about inserting transposes everywhere) but does mean you have to think a little bit about translating from Matlab. In this case extracting a single column with a scalar Numpy simplifies the result to a 1d array - but with a slice it preserves the original dimensions. If you want to stay closer to Matlab semantics you could try using the Matrix class. See NumPy for matlab users page for details. In this case you could do either of the following: m[:0][:newaxis] # gives same as matlab np.matrix(m)[:0] # gives same as matlab But remember if you use matrix class * becomes matrix multiplication and you need to use multiply() for elementwise. (This is all covered in NumPy for Matlab Users page). Generally I would recommend trying to get used to using 1d arrays where you would have column or row vector in matlab and generally things just work. You only need to worry about column vs row when reassembling them into a 2d array. You may be interested in automated matlab to python converters such as OMPC (paper) (I think there are others as well). ohh great i got it :D thank very much  thrope!!! no problem...

I know this is a generic question but I know little of JavaFX and am curious about porting some desktop applications to the web via the JavaFX package. javafx file: import javax.swing.JComponent; import javafx.ext.swing.SwingComponent; class NewFxComponent extends SwingComponent { var comp: JComponent; public override function createJComponent():JComponent { return new OldJComponent(); } },java swing web-applications javafx,0.001285340703777554,0.9691765664116272,0.001791729729230938,0.027746363155364263
2334656,"LEFT JOIN or REGULAR JOIN and how to compare MySql table to an array? Need performance! I have six tables: t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6. And I also have one main table: main_table. TOTAL 7 TABLES! Now I am using SOLR for the searching of classifieds and the results from solr are put into an array. The array results are ID:nrs which I use to match agains the same ID:s in MySql. The first column of ALL tables in MySql is called classified_id. If the user searches for ""cars"" then Solr will find all cars classifieds put the id:s into an array and finally compare the MySql main table to match everything in table t1 (which is the cars table) where classified_id is the same in both tables. The SOLR results array is first imploded then: SELECT * FROM classified t1 WHERE classified.ad_id IN ('$solr_id_arr_imploded') AND classified.classified_id=t1.classified_id My Q is is this how I should do this? Is this how I should JOIN here or use a LEFT JOIN? Is there any faster way of comparing to the array? the table t1 may be empty if there are no car-classifieds... Remember the query could become very very long for example if SOLR returns 10000 matches then an array of 10000 id numbers which look like this would be returned: bmw_m3_low_miles_8948939 Thanks Will the results of the search be paged? That is if the SOLR search returns those 10000 matches do you need to fetch them all at once or just (e.g.) 50 at a time? Hi. The results are paged with MySql LIMIT. Not Solr. However if you know of how to do this in Solr maybe this is how to go then? An alternative to IN is to create a temporary table fill it with the IDs and perform an inner join on that. Make sure the other tables have an index on classified_id. To compare the options use EXPLAIN.",php sql mysql html database,4.584813598505565E-4,7.476976773238969E-4,0.9982198707598595,5.7395020296601E-4
396156,"Automatically size JPanel inside JFrame I have a JPanel subclass on which I add buutons labels tables etc. To show on screen it I use JFrame: MainPanel mainPanel = new MainPanel(); //JPanel subclass JFrame mainFrame = new JFrame(); mainFrame.setTitle(""main window title""); mainFrame.getContentPane().add(mainPanel); mainFrame.setLocation(100 100); mainFrame.pack(); mainFrame.setVisible(true); mainFrame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE); But when I size the window size of panel don't change. How to make size of panel to be the same as the size of window even if it was resized? If the BorderLayout option provided by our friends doesnot work try adding ComponentListerner to the JFrame and implement the componentResized(event) method. When the JFrame object will be resized this method will be called. So if you write the the code to set the size of the JPanel in this method you will achieve the intended result. Ya I know this 'solution' is not good but use it as a safety net. ;)  You can set a layout manager like BorderLayout and then define more specifically where your panel should go: MainPanel mainPanel = new MainPanel(); JFrame mainFrame = new JFrame(); mainFrame.setLayout(new BorderLayout()); mainFrame.add(mainPanel BorderLayout.CENTER); mainFrame.pack(); mainFrame.setVisible(true); This puts the panel into the center area of the frame and lets it grow automatically when resizing the frame.  From my experience I used GridLayout.  thePanel.setLayout(new GridLayout(abcd)); a = row number b = column number c = horizontal gap d = vertical gap. For example if I want to create panel with: unlimited row (set a = 0) 1 column (set b = 1) vertical gap= 3 (set d = 3) The code is below:  thePanel.setLayout(new GridLayout(0103)); This method is useful when you want to add JScrollPane to your JPanel. Size of the JPanel inside JScrollPane will automatically changes when you add some components on it so the JScrollPane will automatically reset the scroll bar.  As other posters have said you need to change the LayoutManager being used. I always preferred using a GridLayout so your code would become: MainPanel mainPanel = new MainPanel(); JFrame mainFrame = new JFrame(); mainFrame.setLayout(new GridLayout()); mainFrame.pack(); mainFrame.setVisible(true); GridLayout seems more conceptually correct to me when you want your panel to take up the entire screen. What about BorderLayout.CENTER?.I think it can used mainly for these kind of cases.  You need to set a layout manager for the JFrame to use - This deals with how components are positioned. A useful one is the BorderLayout manager. Simply adding the following line of code should fix your problems: mainFrame.setLayout(new BorderLayout()); (Do this before adding components to the JFrame) Further reading . The important thing in this case is that a JFrame's default layout manager is FlowLayout.",java swing size jframe jpanel,2.871459924148625E-4,0.9639185608457045,0.035434829255472054,3.594639064085534E-4
210998,Canvas3D not appearing in Swing window I am attempting to insert a Canvas3D object inside a Swing JPanel but the code doesn't seem to be working (i.e. nothing happens):  Canvas3D canvas = new Canvas3D(SimpleUniverse.getPreferredConfiguration()); SimpleUniverse universe = new SimpleUniverse(canvas); BranchGroup root = new BranchGroup(); root.addChild(new ColorCube()); universe.addBranchGraph(root); universe.getViewingPlatform().setNominalViewingTransform(); canvasPanel.add(canvas); What am I missing? The JPanel was created using NetBean's Visual Editor. Probably you have to set a layout manager on the panel which automatically expands the child components to the full area. A JPanel has a FlowLayout by default which does not expand the child components. You could try a BorderLayout instead by calling: canvasPanel.setLayout(new BorderLayout()); Ah that worked perfectly. Thank you!  Canvas3D needs a size passed to it; setting the preferred configuration from SimpleUniverse is not enough. In my case that meant this code:  // 3D canvas initialization Canvas3D canvas = new Canvas3D(SimpleUniverse.getPreferredConfiguration()); SimpleUniverse universe = new SimpleUniverse(canvas); BranchGroup root = new BranchGroup(); root.addChild(new ColorCube()); universe.addBranchGraph(root); universe.getViewingPlatform().setNominalViewingTransform(); canvas.setSize(100 100); canvasPanel.add(canvas);,java swing java-3d,5.63565948066154E-4,0.997945338142806,7.85595492747345E-4,7.055004163805774E-4
297938,"""Always on Top"" Windows with Java In Java is there a way to have a window that is ""Always on top"" regardless if the user switches focus to another application? I've searched the web and all of the solutions lean to some sort of JNI interface with native bindings. Truly this can't be the only way to do it?.. or is it? Try this method of the Window class: Window.setAlwaysOnTop(boolean) It works the same way as the default in the Windows TaskManager: switch to another app but it shows always on top. This was added in Java 1.5 Sample code: import javax.swing.JFrame; import javax.swing.JLabel; public class Annoying { public static void main(String[] args) { JFrame frame = new JFrame(""Hello!!""); // Set's the window to be ""always on top"" frame.setAlwaysOnTop( true ); frame.setLocationByPlatform( true ); frame.add( new JLabel("" Isn't this annoying?"") ); frame.pack(); frame.setVisible( true ); } } Window remains on top even when is not active you would think a simple search for ""java application always on top"" on would have this answer but it couldn't find it. Thanks. Guess what. Now it does!! :) It brings you here! http://www.google.com/search?&q=java+application+always+on+top This is simple and awesome. I was also looking for something like this but didn't know they implemented this in Java 1.5. Thanks for posting. Unfortunately this does not work for me when running a full screen application such as a video game. Anyone know of a way to force it to the top in that situation? @Dream lane I'd probably ask that as a new question This works for a login dialog box but my main application window then goes to the background. I'm open to suggestions. +1 for nothing more than the ""Isn't this annoying"" quip. @MMJZ haha true. Actually I'm surprised I didn't do it for the `args` declaration. I **always** use space after parenthesis. This is a very very old habit that I develop back in the days I used notepad to program. Double clicking on a word would select the parenthesis if there is no space between which was very annoying because I had to delete them afterwards if what I intended to do was re-use the variable somewhere else. This is like the first code I've seen anywhere ever that pads out boolean parameters with spaces.  From my observation I found that AlwaysOnTop privilege is given to the latest process which requested to be always on top. So if you have an application which setAlwaysOnTop(true) and later another application uses this option the privilege is given to the second application. In order to work around this I have set the setAlwaysOnTop(false) and again setAlwaysOnTop(true) whenever any window comes on top of the current window. I've checked it with wordweb in windows. WordWeb is one of the applications which uses AlwaysOnTop option from the OS I'm not sure about if it works properly with your game scenario. Warning: I'm not aware of the side effects. Here is the code example: import java.awt.event.*; import javax.swing.*; public class MainWindow extends JFrame implements WindowFocusListener { public MainWindow() { addWindowFocusListener(this); setAlwaysOnTop(true); this.setFocusable(true); // this.setFocusableWindowState(true); panel = new JPanel(); //setSize(WIDTHHEIGHT); setUndecorated(true); setLocation(XY); setExtendedState(MAXIMIZED_BOTH); setVisible(true); } public void windowGainedFocus(WindowEvent e){} public void windowLostFocus(WindowEvent e) { if(e.getNewState()!=e.WINDOW_CLOSED){ //toFront(); //requestFocus(); setAlwaysOnTop(false); setAlwaysOnTop(true); //requestFocusInWindow(); System.out.println(""focus lost""); } } private JPanel panel; private static final int WIDTH = 200; private static final int HEIGHT = 200; private static final int X = 100; private static final int Y = 100; public static void main(String args[]){ new MainWindow();} }",java gui swing awt,2.774264790087882E-4,0.9707813170207442,0.028593959973323504,3.472965269234517E-4

Does a simple work? Can you please add code for your login form? a more specific title would be nice I've changed a few things and now the browser brings up a dialogue box asking me to download the php. I'm using linux and opera. You will have to check if you have php installed and configured correctly. Also telling us that you *Changed a few things* to solve your *major php problem* isn��t helping us much. If your browser asks you to download the php file it means the php interpreter is not being invoked. i.e. you don't have it installed or configured correctly.  Are you getting any error message? Seems ok to me. Have you tried echoing something in the if-block for example? That might help you understand what's wrong. Some things you could check or try: Have you got error reporting on? Put `var_dump($_POST); die(); on the top of the page to see if the $_POST variables are submitted correctly. Make sure you are not outputting anything to the browser before the header() function. If you have error_reporting off and you outputted something to the browser using header() will result in a fatal error which could cause a blank white page. A few other notes from your code: You don't need to put variables inside double quotes they work on their own: mysqli_select_db(""$db_name"") becomes mysqli_select_db($db_name) You don't need to stripslashes() if you're doing mysql_real_escape_string. The latter will handle the job on its own.  You don't do any ""session_start()"" so your session can't be used. Maybe you need it to started in your ""login_success.php"" script.  In some browsers the Location header is case-sensitive and thus your header(""location:login_success.php""); call might not be working (a comment on the header documentation page suggests that this occurs in IE7). Try capitalizing the l in Location. IIRC In most of browsers headers follow the standard: Uppercase Names and space after "":"".  I agree with Daniel by revising header(""Location: login_success.php""); Also as a side note since at the time of writing this it wasn't clearly explained what didn't work but you when adding session variables you need to have session_start(). Also try to use $_SESSION['variable'] since session_register() is deprecated as of PHP 5.30 taken from PHP: session_register try something like this if($count==1){ session_start(); // Register $myusername $mypassword and redirect to file ���login_success.php�� $_SESSION['username'] = $myusername; $_SESSION['mypassword'] = $mypassword; session_write_close(); // makes sure nothing was lost during redirect header('Location: nextpage.php'); }",php sql database login,1.507281082502729E-4,0.10445733867893324,0.8952032441277223,1.8868908509415787E-4
3221721,Database migration through php I have a mysql database that I am trying to migrate into another database. THey have different schema's and I have written a php script for each table of the old database in order to populate its data in to the new one. The script works just fine but the problem is that it does not move all the data. for example if I have a table and all its info are being selected and then inserted into the new table but only half of them are done. The way I am doing it I am opening a database selecting * and puting it in an associative array. then I close the db connection and connect to the other one go through each element of the array and insert them in the new one. Is there a limit to how big an array could be? what is wrong here? How much data are there in these tables? 10 rows with 20 bytes per row; or more like 10M rows with 1KB per row? 1000000 rows with 0.5 KB per row * 20 tables You may be running into PHP's execution time or memory limits. Make sure the appropriate settings in php.ini are high enough to allow the script to finish executing. can you tell me what are the things I need to look for in there? @Shahin Kian: max_execution_time and max_memory are the two prime suspects. tnx I will do that with what 81403 suggested and i think it should work.  Why not do this via sql scripts? If you prefer to do it via php then you could open connections to both databases and insert to target as you read from source. That way you can avoid using too much memory. I had problem connecting to 2 databases at a time! plus how would I go about reading everything but 1 at a time? (selecting * from table 1 at a time?) you add parameter `LIMIT xy` to your query X being the first row to read and Y the number of row to read. Instead of a static X you use a PHP variable that increments itself in a `while` or `for` loop  Using php to do the transform/convert logic is a possibility. I would do it if you are doing complex transformations and if your php skills are much better thant your mysql skillset. If you need more memory in your php script use: memory_limit = 2048M max_execution_time = 3600 This will give you 2gigs of possible space for the array and about an hour for processing. But if your database is really this big it would much (really a lot) much faster to use: 1. mysqldump to make a dump of your source-server Check it here: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/mysqldump.html 2. Upload the dumpfile and iport it. There are a bunch of example on the mysql documentation page. (Look also in the comments). After this you can transform your database through CREATE/SELECT-statements. CREATE TABLE one SELECT * FROM two; As an alternative you can use UPDATE-statements. What is best depends heavily on the kind of job that you are doing. Good luck!  First of all I don't see the point in writing a script to do this. Why don't you just get a SQL dump from phpMyAdmin and edit it so that it fits the other database? Or are they that different? But to reply on your question: my first thought would be like other people already said that the problem would be the time limit. Before you try to do something about this you should check the value of max_execution_time in php.ini (this is about 30 seconds most of the time) and how long it takes for the script to execute. If it terminates after roughly 30 seconds (or the value of max_execution_time if it's different) then it's likely that that's the problem although php should throw an error (or at least a warning). I don't think there's a limit on the size of an array in php. However there is a directive in php.ini namely memory_limit that defines the amount of memory a script can use. If you are have acces to your php.ini file I suggest setting both max_execution_time and memory_limit to a higher value. If you don't have acces to php.ini you won't be able to change the memory_limit directive. You will have to work your way around this for example by using LIMIT in your SQL. Be sure to unset your used variables or you could run in to the same problem.  It would be preferable to do a mysql dump at the command line: mysqldump -a -u USER_NAME -p SOURCE_DATABASE_NAME > DATA.mysql You can also gzip the file to make it smaller for transfer to another server: gzip DATA.mysql After transfer unzip the file: gunzip -f DATA.mysql.gz And import it: mysql -u USER_NAME -p TARGET_DATABASE_NAME < DATA.sql  You should read the rows from the first database in chunks (of 1000 rows for example) write those rows to the second database clean the array (with unset() or an empty array) and repeat the process until you read all the rows. This overcomes the memory limitations. Another problem might be that the script is running for too long (if the table is too large) so try using the function set_time_limit(). This function resets the timeout for a script after which it should be terminated. I suggest calling it after processing each chunk. thank you I will let you know how it works thanks alot it helped out alot!  You may have constraints in the target database that are rejecting some of your attempted inserts. +1 because this is what really happens without any dramatic error messages. Check your FKs. And remember there are no FKs on a MyIsam table....  Your server (as all server do) will have a memory limit for PHP - if you use more than the assigned limit then the script will fail. Is it possible to just Dump the current MySQL Database into text files perform find-and-replaces or RegExp-based replacements to change the schemas within the text files and then reload the amended test files into MySQL to complete the change? If this is a one-off migration then it may be a better way to do it. that seems like a hassle but thanks for the info,php sql mysql database relational-database,0.003577638657280649,2.734699901447948E-4,0.9209200833291028,0.0752288080234718

1587367,"Python/numpy tricky slicing problem I have a problem with some numpy stuff. I need a numpy array to behave in an unusual manner by returning a slice as a view of the data I have sliced not a copy. So heres an example of what I want to do: Say we have a simple array like this: a = array([1 0 0 0]) I would like to update consecutive entries in the array (moving left to right) with the previous entry from the array using syntax like this: a[1:] = a[0:3] This would get the following result: a = array([1 1 1 1]) Or something like this: a[1:] = 2*a[:3] # a = [1248] To illustrate further I want the following kind of behaviour: for i in range(len(a)): if i == 0 or i+1 == len(a): continue a[i+1] = a[i] Except I want the speed of numpy. The default behavior of numpy is to take a copy of the slice so what I actually get is this: a = array([1 1 0 0]) I already have this array as a subclass of the ndarray so I can make further changes to it if need be I just need the slice on the right hand side to be continually updated as it updates the slice on the left hand side. Am I dreaming or is this magic possible? Update: This is all because I am trying to use Gauss-Seidel iteration to solve a linear algebra problem more or less. It is a special case involving harmonic functions I was trying to avoid going into this because its really not necessary and likely to confuse things further but here goes. The algorithm is this: while not converged: for i in range(len(u[:0])): for j in range(len(u[0:])): # skip over boundary entries ij == 0 or len(u) u[ij] = 0.25*(u[i-1j] + u[i+1j] + u[i j-1] + u[ij+1]) Right? But you can do this two ways Jacobi involves updating each element with its neighbours without considering updates you have already made until the while loop cycles to do it in loops you would copy the array then update one array from the copied array. However Gauss-Seidel uses information you have already updated for each of the i-1 and j-1 entries thus no need for a copy the loop should essentially 'know' since the array has been re-evaluated after each single element update. That is to say every time we call up an entry like u[i-1j] or u[ij-1] the information calculated in the previous loop will be there. I want to replace this slow and ugly nested loop situation with one nice clean line of code using numpy slicing: u[1:-11:-1] = 0.25(u[:-21:-1] + u[2:1:-1] + u[1:-1:-2] + u[1:-12:]) But the result is Jacobi iteration because when you take a slice: u[:-21:-1] you copy the data thus the slice is not aware of any updates made. Now numpy still loops right? Its not parallel its just a faster way to loop that looks like a parallel operation in python. I want to exploit this behaviour by sort of hacking numpy to return a pointer instead of a copy when I take a slice. Right? Then every time numpy loops that slice will 'update' or really just replicate whatever happened in the update. To do this I need slices on both sides of the array to be pointers. Anyway if there is some really really clever person out there that awesome but I've pretty much resigned myself to believing the only answer is to loop in C. just to clarify again this is not what you want: a[1:] = 2*a[:3]; a[:3] = [100] so we now have a = [1200] but our a[:3] is now [120] so a becomes [1240] and once again a[:3] is [124] so we assign that to a[1:] and a becomes [1248] -- and now finally a[1:] ([248]) = 2*a[:3] (2*[124]) so our assignment is finished. what you're saying is that that's NOT what you want to happen? just to put an analogy on what you're trying to do since most people don't seem to understand it: it's somewhat like pointing a video camera at a television screen displaying its own output. so what you want is some sort of recursive assignment -- but i don't believe there is any guarantee that this will settle down into a constant value. sure it does in your case but not in general -- for example: `a[:] = 2*a[:]` would loop forever. so no what you want is not possible in numpy without explicitly looping and comparing until propagation of values is done. @daver I don't think you're getting how numpy works. When you say a[1:] = 2*a[:3] there are _two_ loops. The first one is 2*a[:3] which makes a temporary array. And then a second loop does the assignment. a[1:] is not getting assigned from itself but from a temporary. The problem is not that a[:3] isn't a view into a because it is but that 2*a[:3] is a completely different array. Numpy is giving you the speed of C but at the cost of more temporaries. Once you grasp this you'll see why you can't easily do what you want in NumPy without delving into lower-level stuff. @daver: unfortunately what i described before will not work in general in numpy since there is no convergence guarantee. as i said before a[:] = 2*a[:] would loop forever. for example if a = [1 1 1] then going through a[:] = 2*a[:] gives a = 2*[111] so a[:] is assigned [222]. so now we have a[:] ([222]) = 2*[222] which aren't equal so we go again: a[:] ([444]) = 2*[444]... etc it'll never converge. the only fixed point of a[:] = 2*a[:] is if a = [000] anything else will grow exponentially. What you described is *exactly* what I want to happen. Numpy appears to assign a bunch of stuff at once in reality it is just looping somewhere else. Default behaviour is like this first round: a = [1200]  second round: a = [1200] third round: a = [1200]. If the slice a[:3] were a pointer to a's data (view I think its called in numpy) then after the first round that slice would have updated so it would then be: a[:3] = [120] then a becomes: [1240] then the slice is pointing at a's data so a[:3] = [124] and infally we end up with a = [1248]. @daver: can you post a proper example using a loop? for now the loop is the same as a[1:]=a[1]. the for loop is the same of a[1:]=a[1]... Andrea don't try to think about how you could solve this trivial example in a simpler way think about the mechanics of what is going on yes the output is the same as a[1:] = a[0] but in the general case not even close. Why would that loop forever? And no it is not some sort of recursive assignment it is simple iteration. I just want like a pointer instead of a deep copy of my array when I take a slice of it its not really that hard to comprehend surely?? The problem with the ""kind of behavior... a[i+1]=a[i]"" is that it is such a trivial case that even though many of the posted solutions fulfil it you're not satisfied and neither is anyone else and no one can recognize a possible answer as an actual answer. That's why I asked you to give a simple but NON-TRIVIAL example of what you want using numbers other than 1 and 0. Do this and you may get a good answer. (But not from me I've read this problem too many times already.) Dude I'm sorry man but you asked me to update my question so that it is clearer I have done that and I have provided a case other than 1 and 0. You even replied to a comment I made where I gave you a cut down version of the 2-d thing I am using this on. Not one single response addresses the problem none of them so what you just said is simply not true. I'm sorry man. I even know the technical details of what I am after I'm specifically asking: can I get a slice to return a pointer to my data instead of a deep copy? And read my question it is in there. Did you look at the link in my answer to the SciPy page on Performance Python. The actual example of solving Laplace's equation using Gauss-Seidel iteration. They explicitly mention having to use a temporary to do what you want if you stick to pure NumPy and then give more advanced techniques to avoid that. Thanks for the link but it doesn't solve the problem I'm afraid. I've already implemented exactly what they have on that page but they even admit that it is not updating the entries in the manner I want to: ""... However since the NumPy expression uses temporaries internally only the old value of u[11] will be used."". It works but its called Jacobi iteration not Gauss-Seidel. Unfortunately I have to use Gauss-Seidel for an assignment. Thanks anyway. I am sorry but I don't understand very well your question... Anyway have you tried with a.copy()? What you're asking for is largely senseless. Why should you be able to say `a[0:3]` and have is mean `a[0]` only? That's incomprehensible. -1: I don't get your question either. Can you formalize what the behavior should be and break it down into well defined steps? First implement a simple for-loop version then we can maybe help you to optimize it. Did you ever get solved this? I just did exactly what is indicated here and usign Jacobi negates the speed of numpy because you need many more iterations. Late answer but this turned up on Google so I probably point to the doc the OP wanted. Your problem is clear: when using NumPy slices temporaries are created. Wrap your code in a quick call to weave.blitz to get rid of the temporaries and have the behaviour your want. Read the weave.blitz section of PerformancePython tutorial for full details.  It is not the correct logic. I'll try to use letters to explain it. Image array = abcd with abcd as elements. Now array[1:] means from the element in position 1 (starting from 0) on. In this case:bcd and array[0:3] means from the character in position 0 up to the third character (the one in position 3-1) in this case: 'abc'. Writing something like: array[1:] = array[0:3] means: replace bcd with abc To obtain the output you want now in python you should use something like: a[1:] = a[0] I've just read his comment above. The question is pretty unclear so. The fist part of my post explain why it does not work as the OP thinks. I'm waiting for a question improvement to try to solve his problem. It is not clear as he would want to update it. I did edit it it should be very clear now. Sorry this is my first post what I want to know is why this question got 3 downvotes? I commented on the question. I didn't downvoted this but I think it got downvoted because of the unclear exposition. Try to provide an alternative working way to solve the problem or at least to explain the algorithm you'd like to be used in the details. Andrea I have updated again with even more information I'm afraid I don't think it makes it any clearer but its there if you are interested. And yeah I got downvotes after I clarified things so I'm thinking theres a bit of people confusing not understanding the problem with my explanation of it going on. Yes the original question was vague and oversimplified. Found clarification in a comment. I wonder why people are afraid to edit original posts? The OP is trying to do something more sophisticated than that. The goal is to update elements of a slice based on element values that were updated in the current operation. It's hard to comprehend but it's much faster than traditional python loops.  You could have a look at np.lib.stride_tricks. There is some information in these excellent slides: http://mentat.za.net/numpy/numpy_advanced_slides/ with stride_tricks starting at slide 29. I'm not completely clear on the question though so can't suggest anything more concrete - although I would probably do it in cython or fortran with f2py or with weave. I'm liking fortran more at the moment because by the time you add all the required type annotations in cython I think it ends up looking less clear than the fortran. There is a comparison of these approaches here: www. scipy. org/ PerformancePython (can't post more links as I'm a new user) with an example that looks similar to your case.  Numpy must be checking if the target array is the same as the input array when doing the setkey call. Luckily there are ways around it. First I tried using numpy.put instead In [46]: a = numpy.array([1000]) In [47]: numpy.put(a[123]a[0:3]) In [48]: a Out[48]: array([1 1 1 1]) And then from the documentation of that I gave using flatiters a try (a.flat) In [49]: a = numpy.array([1000]) In [50]: a.flat[1:] = a[0:3] In [51]: a Out[51]: array([1 1 1 1]) But this doesn't solve the problem you had in mind In [55]: a = np.array([1000]) In [56]: a.flat[1:] = 2*a[0:3] In [57]: a Out[57]: array([1 2 0 0]) This fails because the multiplication is done before the assignment not in parallel as you would like. Numpy is designed for repeated application of the exact same operation in parallel across an array. To do something more complicated unless you can find decompose it in terms of functions like numpy.cumsum and numpy.cumprod you'll have to resort to something like scipy.weave or writing the function in C. (See the PerfomancePython page for more details.) (Also I've never used weave so I can't guarantee it will do what you want.)  It must have something to do with assigning a slice. Operators however as you may already know do follow your expected behavior: >>> a = numpy.array([1000]) >>> a[1:]+=a[:3] >>> a array([1 1 1 1]) If you already have zeros in your real-world problem where your example does then this solves it. Otherwise at added cost set them to zero either by multiplying by zero or assigning to zero (whichever is faster) edit: I had another thought. You may prefer this: numpy.put(a[123]a[:3])  In the end I came up with the same problem as you. I had to resort to use Jacobi iteration and weaver:  while (iter_n < max_time_steps): expr = ""field[1:-1 1:-1] = (field[2: 1:-1] ""\ ""+ field[:-2 1:-1]+""\ ""field[1:-1 2:] +""\ ""field[1:-1 :-2] )/4."" weave.blitz(expr check_size=0) #Toroidal conditions field[:0] = field[:self.flow.n_x - 2] field[:self.flow.n_x -1] = field[:1] iter_n = iter_n + 1 It works and is fast but is not Gauss-Seidel so convergence can be a bit tricky. The only option of doing Gauss-Seidel as a traditional loop with indexes.  accumulate is designed to do what you seem to want; that is to proprigate an operation along an array. Here's an example: from numpy import * a = array([1000]) a[1:] = add.accumulate(a[0:3]) # a = [1 1 1 1] b = array([1111]) b[1:] = multiply.accumulate(2*b[0:3]) # b = [1 2 4 8] Another way to do this is to explicitly specify the result array as the input array. Here's an example: c = array([2000]) multiply(c[:3] c[:3] c[1:]) # c = [ 2 4 16 256]  i would suggest cython instead of looping in c. there might be some fancy numpy way of getting your example to work using a lot of intermediate steps... but since you know how to write it in c already just write that quick little bit as a cython function and let cython's magic make the rest of the work easy for you.  Just use a loop. I can't immediately think of any way to make the slice operator behave the way you're saying you want it to except maybe by subclassing numpy's array and overriding the appropriate method with some sort of Python voodoo... but more importantly the idea that a[1:] = a[0:3] should copy the first value of a into the next three slots seems completely nonsensical to me. I imagine that it could easily confuse anyone else who looks at your code (at least the first few times). No no no its not copying the first value into the next three its updating each consecutive entry with data from the previous entry. However each time it updates I want it to be aware of the previous update. Yes I can loop but its extremely slow and clumsy for the purpose I have in mind. But heres what it would look like in a loop: for i in a: *Dammit sorry i hit tab and it updated my comment... the code: for i in a: a[i+1] = a[i] The point is this is for a 2 dimensional array and is a specific numeric algorithm that I need to implement. why not just a[1:4]=a[0]? unknown: You really don't want the array copy to work that way. How would you copy parts of the array if it worked that way? gnibbler: That completely misses the point of the algorithm this is a simple example what I am doing is Gauss-Seidel iteration which infers information about a location in a matrix by using data that has already been inferred in previous entries. Deep in the machinery of numpy as I understand it it performs this loop. However it loops over the copy of the original data in the slice. I want it to loop over the slice and update the slice as it goes. Maybe I could make it clearer like this: a[1:] = 2*a[0:3] with the expected result being: a = [1248]. Oh yeah and no I do not want my array copy to work like that I want my array slice to not be a copy I want my array slice to be a view of the data contained in the array. Please fix the question. Do no correct your question in the comments on an answer. Please update the question with this revised description of the problem. One of the main advantages to numpy is the ability to avoid expensive python iterations. (aka broadcasting). The question is perfectly valid and a reasonable thing to expect numpy to do.",python numpy slice,0.0014546449578237606,0.03477278031210005,0.0028679701247672582,0.9609046046053089
679210,How can I use a dynamically sized texture array with glTexImage2D? Currently I'm able to load in a static sized texture which I have created. In this case it's 512 x 512. This code is from the header: #define TEXTURE_WIDTH 512 #define TEXTURE_HEIGHT 512 GLubyte textureArray[TEXTURE_HEIGHT][TEXTURE_WIDTH][4]; Here's the usage of glTexImage2D: glTexImage2D( GL_TEXTURE_2D 0 GL_RGBA TEXTURE_WIDTH TEXTURE_HEIGHT 0 GL_RGBA GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE textureArray); And here's how I'm populating the array (rough example not exact copy from my code): for (int i = 0; i < getTexturePixelCount(); i++) { textureArray[column][row][0] = (GLubyte)pixelValue1; textureArray[column][row][1] = (GLubyte)pixelValue2; textureArray[column][row][2] = (GLubyte)pixelValue3; textureArray[column][row][3] = (GLubyte)pixelValue4; } How do I change that so that there's no need for TEXTURE_WIDTH and TEXTURE_HEIGHT? Perhaps I could use a pointer style array and dynamically allocate the memory... Edit: I think I see the problem in C++ it can't really be done. The work around as pointed out by Budric is to use a single dimensional array but use all 3 dimensions multiplied to represent what would be the indexes: GLbyte *array = new GLbyte[xMax * yMax * zMax]; And to access for example x/y/z of 1/2/3 you'd need to do: GLbyte byte = array[1 * 2 * 3]; However the problem is I don't think the glTexImage2D function supports this. Can anyone think of a workaround that would work with this OpenGL function? Edit 2: Attention OpenGL developers this can be overcome by using a single dimensional array of pixels... [0]: column 0 > [1]: row 0 > [2]: channel 0 ... n > [n]: row 1 ... n > [n]: column 1 .. n ... no need to use a 3 dimensional array. In this case I've had to use this work around as 3 dimensional arrays are apparently not strictly possible in C++. You don't simply multiply the indices. It's (rowIndex * numColumns * numColourComponents + columnIndex + colourComponent); Oops. Should be (rowIndex * numColumns * numColourComponents + columnIndex*numColourComponents + colourComponent); You could always wrap it up in a class. If you are loading the image from a file you get the height and width out with the rest of the data (how else could you use the file?) you could store them in a class that wraps the file loading instead of using preprocessor defines. Something like: class ImageLoader { ... ImageLoader(const char* filename ...); ... int GetHeight(); int GetWidth(); void* GetDataPointer(); ... }; Even better you could hide the function calls to glTexImage2d in there with it. class GLImageLoader { ... ImageLoader(const char* filename ...); ... GLuint LoadToTexture2D(); // returns texture id ... };  Ok since this took me ages to figure this out here it is: My task was to implement the example from the OpenGL Red Book (9-1 p373 5th Ed.) with a dynamic texture array. The example uses: static GLubyte checkImage[checkImageHeight][checkImageWidth][4]; Trying to allocate a 3-dimensional array as you would guess won't do the job. Someth. like this does NOT work: GLubyte***checkImage; checkImage = new GLubyte**[HEIGHT]; for (int i = 0; i < HEIGHT; ++i) { checkImage[i] = new GLubyte*[WIDTH]; for (int j = 0; j < WIDTH; ++j) checkImage[i][j] = new GLubyte[DEPTH]; } You have to use a one dimensional array: unsigned int depth = 4; GLubyte *checkImage = new GLubyte[height * width * depth]; You can access the elements using this loops: for(unsigned int ix = 0; ix < height; ++ix) { for(unsigned int iy = 0; iy < width; ++iy) { int c = (((ix&0x8) == 0) ^ ((iy&0x8)) == 0) * 255; checkImage[ix * width * depth + iy * depth + 0] = c; //red checkImage[ix * width * depth + iy * depth + 1] = c; //green checkImage[ix * width * depth + iy * depth + 2] = c; //blue checkImage[ix * width * depth + iy * depth + 3] = 255; //alpha } } Don't forget to delete it properly: delete [] checkImage; Hope this helps... +1 for putting so much effort in to a 3 year old question. Helped me out too ! SO take my vote...This is one of those little intricacies of OpenGL  You can use int width = 1024; int height = 1024; GLubyte * texture = new GLubyte[4*width*height]; ... glTexImage2D( GL_TEXTURE_2D 0 GL_RGBA width height 0 GL_RGBA GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE textureArray); delete [] texture; //remove the un-needed local copy of the texture; However you still need to specify the width and height to OpenGL in glTexImage2D call. This call copies texture data and that data is managed by OpenGL. You can delete resize change your original texture array all you want and it won't make a different to the texture you specified to OpenGL. Edit: C/C++ deals with only 1 dimensional arrays. The fact that you can do texture[a][b] is hidden and converted by the compiler at compile time. The compiler must know the number of columns and will do texture[a*cols + b]. Use a class to hide the allocation access to the texture. For academic purposes if you really want dynamic multi dimensional arrays the following should work: int rows = 16 cols = 16; char * storage = new char[rows * cols]; char ** accessor2D = new char *[rows]; for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) { accessor2D[i] = storage + i*cols; } accessor2D[5][5] = 2; assert(storage[5*cols + 5] == accessor2D[5][5]); delete [] accessor2D; delete [] storage; Notice that in all the cases I'm using 1D arrays. They are just arrays of pointers and array of pointers to pointers. There's memory overhead to this. Also this is done for 2D array without colour components. For 3D dereferencing this gets really messy. Don't use this in your code. @Budric my array needs to have 3 dimensions not 2. I'm accessing it in the style of texture[column][row][channel] Hmm this would work only when assigning values to the array I get this error: invalid types ���unsigned char[int]�� for array subscript Are you using texture[i][j]?

Since vec3_t is an alias for GLfloat[3] does it mean that vec3_t[num_xyz* num_frames] is equivalent to GLfloat[3][num_xyz* num_frames]; 2. If the above is a 2 dimentional array How is it supporsed to be properly deleted from memory? thanks in advance; from deo GLfloat is an array that is ""statically"" allocated and thus that doesn't need to be explicitly deallocated. From a memory point of view this typedef is equivalent to the following structure: typedef struct { GLfloat f1; GLfloat f2; GLfloat f3; } vec3_t; You can then have the following code which is now less confusing: vec3_t* vertices = new vec3_t [num_xyz* num_frames]; [...] delete[] vertices;  It will be deleted the same way it's been allocated - one contiguous piece of memory. See 2D array memory layout this not entirely correct there is a difference between allocation an array and allocating a single object. that's why you have delete vs delete[] The visualization in the first example of your link is misleading - ttt is defined as an array not as a pointer.  1. a two dimensional array can be thoght of as a one dimensional array where each element is an array. using this definition you can see that new vec3_t[num_xyz* num_frames] is equivalent to a two dimensional array. 2. this array is made of num_xyz* num_frames members each taking a space of sizeof (vec3_t) when new is carried out it allocates num_xyz* num_frames memory blokes in the heap it takes note of this number so that when calling delete[] it will know how many blocks of sizeof (vec3_t) it should mark as free in the heap.  You almost got it right vec3_t[num_xyz* num_frames] is equivalent to GLfloat[num_xyz* num_frames][3] Since you allocated with new[] you have to delete with delete[].  I think that the delete is OK but to reduce confusion I tend to do this: struct vec3_t{ GLFloat elems[3]; }; vec3_t* vertices = new vec3_t[num_xyz* num_frames]; Now you can see the type of vertices and: delete [] vertices; is obviously correct.",c++ opengl,0.725843664040824,4.973206268009737E-4,4.25095358718099E-4,0.2732339199736569

2173201,"How should I query MySQL and how to cache the results from MySQL? I have managed finally to get Solr working with the help of all you guys so THANK YOU! And I have to say I now understand why you recommended it it's really powerful. Now to the issue... I have indexed all ""Searchable"" information into Solr and my plan is to query Solr and then get the ID:s of the query-results (of all records that is each has an ID field value) which I then use to query MySQL and fetch the rest of the information. So first query Solr next solr sends back id:s for all ads which match the query then I use the ID:s to query MySQL for the rest of the info. My Q is When doing the part with MySql should I save all the received ID:s into an array and then query mysql to find all records with those ID:s? Should I do something like this? (might contain some code errors):  for ($i=0; $i<$id_from_solr.length; $i++){ mysql_query(""SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE ad_id=$id_from_solr[$i]""); } The above seems not like a good solution because it does a ""new query"" everytime it loops again! How would you do it? Follow-up Question: Would adding a sort function into the MySQL query slow things down compared to WITHOUT using the sort function? for example:  ORDER BY insert_date ASC And last Q: Is there anyway to cache MySQL results so when sorting I don't have to make a new query? Thanks alot! If you need more input let me know and I will update this Q! If the query is slow with the _ORDER BY_ try addind an INDEX on that coulomb. I think you meant ""cache"" rather than ""catch"" - I've made this edit for clarity. For the first part here's how I would write a single query statement: $instr=implode("" ""$id_from_solr); $stmt = ""SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE ad_id IN ("".$instr."")"";  Question 1 (retrieving IDs and then querying the database): why not return some of your fields from the Solr query so that you don't always have to hit the database as well? Q2 (Performance and sorting): well sorting represents an extra task to perform on your data so it is bound to add a bit of work for the database: this can of course be minimized if you have an index on your ORDER BY column(s). Q3 (catching MySql queries): you can either turn on the MySql cache (which will return a cached copy of your results if the request matched a previous one assuming the data has not been changed in the interim) or use a caching layer outside of the database such as EhCache: http://ehcache.org/",php sql mysql database,3.804477067929194E-4,6.204393277951135E-4,0.998522849244237,4.7626372117488857E-4

The problem was something in my system with graphic drivers. Anyway thanks for your answers!  My guess is it's crashing on SDL_PollEvent(). It returns 1/true if there is an event 0/false if not. When it does return true it will be a certain type of SDL_Event based on event.type. SDL_Event is a union of all SDL events and some info in one event is not guaranteed to be in the same order type etc as another. So you just need to check the type of the event and handle it as necessary.. Check out the docs for more info of course. Something like this: if (SDL_PollEvent(&event)) { switch (event.type) { case SDL_KEYUP: if (event.key.keysym.sym == SDLK_ESCAPE) done = 1; } } That would not _crash_. It will read from uninitialized memory or a previous event value so it could __quit__ prematurely.

1909994,"How do I add rows and columns to a NUMPY array? Hello I have a 1000 data series with 1500 points in each. They form a (1000x1500) size Numpy array created using np.zeros((1500 1000)) and then filled with the data. Now what if I want the array to grow to say 1600 x 1100? Do I have to add arrays using hstack and vstack or is there a better way? I would want the data already in the 1000x1500 piece of the array not to be changed only blank data (zeros) added to the bottom and right basically. Thanks. If you want zeroes in the added elements my_array.resize((1600 1000)) should work. Note that this differs from numpy.resize(my_array (1600 1000)) in which previous lines are duplicated which is probably not what you want. Otherwise (for instance if you want to avoid initializing elements to zero which could be unnecessary) you can indeed use hstack and vstack to add an array containing the new elements; numpy.concatenate() (see pydoc numpy.concatenate) should work too (it is just more general as far as I understand). In either case I would guess that a new memory block has to be allocated in order to extend the array and that all these methods take about the same time. Just a note that this doesn't appear to keep the data in place in the case when you merely want to extend the data set: >>> a = numpy.array([[12][34]]) >>> a array([[1 2] [3 4]]) >>> a.resize((24)) Traceback (most recent call last): File """" line 1 in ValueError: cannot resize an array references or is referenced by another array in this way. Use the resize function >>> a = numpy.array(a) >>> a.resize((24)) >>> a array([[1 2 3 4] [0 0 0 0]])  No matter what you'll be stuck reallocating a chunk of memory so it doesn't really matter if you use arr.resize() np.concatenate hstack/vstack etc. Note that if you're accumulating a lot of data sequentially Python lists are usually more efficient.  This should do what you want (ie using 3x3 array and 4x4 array to represent the two arrays in the OP) >>> import numpy as NP >>> a = NP.random.randint(0 10 9).reshape(3 3) >>> a >>> array([[1 2 2] [7 0 7] [0 3 0]]) >>> b = NP.zeros((4 4)) mapping a on to b: >>> b[:3:3] = a >>> b array([[ 1. 2. 2. 0.] [ 7. 0. 7. 0.] [ 0. 3. 0. 0.] [ 0. 0. 0. 0.]]) @k��ives yes a typo thank you--editing my post now.

2467146,"Left Join 3 Tables and Show True or False on Empty Cells Ok this may be confusing so I hope I explain it correctly. I have 4 tables: business photos video category I want to display ""featured"" businesses on the home page (or elsewhere) and I want to show a Yes or No in the table row based upon whether or not there are photos or videos for that business. Example: Joes Crab Shack has no videos or photos but is featured. So when his row is echoed out it will show the Business Name and Business Owner but there will be no data in the photo or video cells thus in the video and photos column it will say No. Otherwise if the opposite was true it would say Yes. Here's my pastebin I'm thinking perhaps it might be better to have separate functions since on the individual business pages I will be listing photos and videos anyway. Maybe I'm making this harder then it needs to be? Since I will need to have functions that query for videos photos and specials anyway would it be possible to while the initial table is being displayed to check the db for the presence of these items? In other words when the row for Joes is being echoed a function runs to check for photos etc? But how would it know to check for Joes and not Bobs? SELECT b.busname  b.busowner  b.webaddress  IF (EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM photos p WHERE p.busid = b.id) 'Yes' 'No') has_photo  IF (EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM video v WHERE v.busid = b.id) 'Yes' 'No') has_video FROM business b WHERE b.featured = 1  Ok here is what I was able to do to solve the problem based upon suggestions from you guys: Model: function frontPageList() { $this->db->select('b.busname b.busowner b.webaddress p.photoname v.title'); $this->db->from ('business AS b'); $this->db->where('featured' '1'); $this->db->join('photos AS p' 'p.busid = b.id' 'left'); $this->db->join('video AS v' 'v.busid = b.id' 'left'); return $this->db->get(); } Control: function index() { $this->load->model('Business_model'); $data['featured'] = $this->Business_model->frontPageList(); $data['user_id'] = $this->tank_auth->get_user_id(); $data['username'] = $this->tank_auth->get_username(); $data['page_title'] = 'Welcome To Jerome - Largest Ghost Town in America'; $data['page'] = 'welcome_message'; // pass the actual view to use as a parameter $this->load->view('container'$data); } View: <table id=""businessTable""> <thead><tr><th>Business Name</th><th>Business Owner</th><th>Web</th><th>Photos</th><th>Videos</th></tr></thead> <?php foreach ($featured->result() as $row): ?> <tr> <td><?=$row->busname?></td> <td><?=$row->busowner?></td> <td><a href=""<?=$row->webaddress?>"">Visit Site</a></td> <td> <?php if(isset($row->photoname)):?> no <?php else:?> yes <?php endif?> </td> <td> <?php if(isset($row->title)):?> no <?php else:?> yes <?php endif?> </td> </tr> <?php endforeach; ?> </table>  You can cheat a little with something like this: SELECT b.[other stuff] (SELECT COUNT(1) FROM photos WHERE busid = b.id) AS photo_count (SELECT COUNT(1) FROM videos WHERE busid = b.id) AS video_count FROM business AS b [etc] photo_count & video_count will return 0 or greater than 0 - easy enough to get no/yes from in PHP. That would also stop the duplicate results you'd get from having more than 1 photo/video per business. Caveat!: converting that to the ORM you're using... I'm not sure an ORM would be okay with it. But if it's not barking over the ""AS"" aliasing in from() & join() maybe you can sneak the subqueries in select() without any problems. Would it make more sense to have a separate function that checks for photos or videos based upon the b.id? You mean in a PHP function? That might be cleaner but I doubt it would have a positive effect - one query is speedier than the same split into 3 if only because it's calling out to the DB once. ok just wondered. i'm having an issue with doing the select counts using activerecord. i wondered if maybe i was trying to do too much.  I'm going to take a stab at this. What I would do is when generating the table for display of ""featured"" businesses I would make a call to your database the one generally made when generating the photos and videos categories and check the output. If there is something there then have it say yes if the return from the database is null it's a safe assumption there aren't any photos or videos and thus you can print out a No. Your suggestion worked I posted an answer to the problem below but since it was your suggestion I'll give you the credit. @ Jason Shultz - Thanks.  I'm going to assume here that your photos and videos tables contain more than 1 record per business a ""one to many"" relationship. In this case you're going to need to rethink your approach or at least do some formatting of your database results. Currently if Joes crab shack has more than 1 videos and/or photos you're going to have multiple results for Joes crab shack. If you need photos/videos results you could format the results as you are receiving them now to create a multi dimensional array/object where $featured['videos'] or $featured['photos] would contain the results of your join if your formatted array doesn't contain the 'videos' key then you have no video results. If all you need to know is if it's returning more than 0 rows then create two new methods in your model to count videos and photos that belong to a specific business. Now it's just a matter of echo'ing 'Yes' if the methods return more than 0 rows or 'No' otherwise. Edit: Model function should look something like this function frontPageList() { $this->db->select('b.busname b.busowner b.webaddress'); $this->db->select('(SELECT COUNT(1) FROM photos WHERE busid = b.id) AS photo_count' FALSE); $this->db->select('(SELECT COUNT(1) FROM videos WHERE busid = b.id) AS video_count' FALSE); $this->db->from ('business AS b'); $this->db->where('featured' '1'); return $this->db->get(); } The query you have now is fine for displaying the business info you just need to format the results into a multi dimensional array before outputting it to your view. You're likely going to need a count function in your model at some point in your project you can create those now and use them or use the suggested nested query from tadamson. I'll edit my answer with an example of how to use the nested query with CI's Active Record Eventually what I want to do is have an individual business page where all the photos and videos will be listed. but on the list of buisnesses page I just want to show if they have things like photos or videos or specials/coupons. Would I be better off having separate functions one for showing the business info and then separate functions checking for photos and videos and specials and either showing yes or no in the list and showing the actual results on the business page?  Im assuming that the tables are set up sort of like this: Business Info Photos Videos ? You would create a unique ID for each business (autoincrement works nicely) and whenever a photo or video is uploaded for the business that record would be inserted into the respective tables with that ID attached to it (the ID column or whatever). Each table would allow multiple entries for the business (""one to many"" as Dyllon noted). So whenever you are displaying the featured business you would run a query against both the video and photo tables using the unique ID and look for returned rows. Rows = yes !rows = no. One question: Are you going to store the images in the db or file names and have them uploaded to a directory? The only other input that I would add to the above recommendations is to structure your tables so that there are never any null values in the tables themselves which may be the case seeing as you have four tables for this project already. I second the multi dimensional array/object method of storing and sorting through the returned data. A nice touch would be to use the PHP image functions to resize the first image returned as a thumbnail for the photos - you could also catch a frame for each video as well - so instead of yes or no we would seem thumbnails for both or a 'no images/video' slug.

623127,OpenGL coordinate problem I am creating a simple 2D OpenGL application but I seem to be experiencing some camera issues. When I draw a rectangle at (2020) it is drawn at (2520) or so. When I draw it at (100 20) it is drawn at 125 or so. For some reasons everything is being shifted to the right by a few %. I have pasted a trimmed down version here http://pastebin.com/m56491c4c Is there something wrong with the way I am setting up GLUT? I know it's not my objects doing anything weird since the same thing happens when I disable them. Thanks in advance. It depends on what system you are working on but usually most windows coordinate systems start at the bottom left corner and count up to the top and to the right. In this case your gluOrth02D call would be wrong. You Have: gluOrtho2D(0 appWidth appHeight 0); Which has the top of the window mapping to the bottom vice-verse. Most of the time it's: gluOrtho2D(0 appWidth 0 appHeight); As I said it depends on the system platform your working with. I can only speak for most linux implementations. Just something else to check out just in case it affecting your bug.  You seem to be calling your glOrtho2D on your ModelView matrix. I doubt that that's the problem (since I guess in this case your Projection should be the identity) but you should still call it on your Projection matrix instead. You should also print out w and h in your resize call just to make sure that your window size is actually what you think it is (I don't know how glut works but glutInitWindowSize() may include borders which would mess things up). I've already tried setting it up in the order you suggested without any luck. I've messed around with the outputs and am fairly confident that the window size is correct. All out of ideas.  You need to set the projection matrix inside the reshape function (resize()) which also automatically solves the problem of the user resizing the window: void resize(int w int h) { glMatrixMode(GL_PROJECTION); glLoadIdentity(); gluOrtho2D(0 w h 0); } And then in your draw function make sure that the matrix mode is model-view: void draw() { glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW); glLoadIdentity(); ... } Other problems with your code: You probably shouldn't be calling glutPostRedisplay() at the end of draw(). This is going to make your CPU run at 100%. You can instead use glutTimerFunc() to still have updates every some number of milliseconds. In processMouse() you're using wsprintf() on an array of chars: wsprintf() takes an array of wide characters (wchar_t) so you should make the local variable s of type wchar_t[] or use sprintf() and MessageBoxA() instead of wsprintf() and MessageBoxW() (to which MessageBox() expands as a macro when compiling a Unicode application which I'm assuming you're doing). You're also vulnerable to a buffer overflow -- you should use a buffer of at least 12 characters even though realistically you'll never be passed a very large x value. Finally you should also use snprintf()/wsnprintf() instead of sprintf()/wsprintf() to protect against the buffer overflow. Thanks that fixed it! Thanks for your other suggestions.

1322380,"gotchas where Numpy differs from straight python? Folks is there a collection of gotchas where Numpy differs from python points that have puzzled and cost time ? ""The horror of that moment I shall never never forget !"" ""You will though"" the Queen said ""if you don't make a memorandum of it."" For example NaNs are always trouble anywhere. If you can explain this without running it give yourself a point -- from numpy import array NaN isnan pynan = float(""nan"") print pynan is pynan pynan is NaN NaN is NaN a = (0 pynan) print a a[1] is pynan any([aa is pynan for aa in a]) a = array(( 0 NaN )) print a a[1] is NaN isnan( a[1] ) (I'm not knocking numpy lots of good work there just think a FAQ or Wiki of gotchas would be useful.) Edit: I was hoping to collect half a dozen gotchas (surprises for people learning Numpy). Then if there are common gotchas or better common explanations we could talk about adding them to a community Wiki (where ?) It doesn't look like we have enough so far. should be community wiki No one mentioned primitive types. Does this mean a python float is equivalent to a np.float and so on? The biggest gotcha for me was that almost every standard operator is overloaded to distribute across the array. Define a list and an array >>> l = range(10) >>> l [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9] >>> import numpy >>> a = numpy.array(l) >>> a array([0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]) Multiplication duplicates the python list but distributes over the numpy array >>> l * 2 [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9] >>> a * 2 array([ 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18]) Addition and division are not defined on python lists >>> l + 2 Traceback (most recent call last): File ""<stdin>"" line 1 in <module> TypeError: can only concatenate list (not ""int"") to list >>> a + 2 array([ 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11]) >>> l / 2.0 Traceback (most recent call last): File ""<stdin>"" line 1 in <module> TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'list' and 'float' >>> a / 2.0 array([ 0.  0.5 1.  1.5 2.  2.5 3.  3.5 4.  4.5]) Numpy overloads to treat lists like arrays sometimes >>> a + a array([ 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18]) >>> a + l array([ 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18]) Yes that got me too. A simple table with columns: op python numpy would settle that. Actually ``a + a`` **is** defined for lists. It concatenates them.  A 0-d array of None looks like None but it is not the same: In [1]: print None None In [2]: import numpy In [3]: print numpy.array(None) None In [4]: numpy.array(None) is None Out[4]: False In [5]: numpy.array(None) == None Out[5]: False In [6]: print repr(numpy.array(None)) array(None dtype=object)  print pynan is pynan pynan is NaN NaN is NaN This tests identity that is if it is the same object. The result should therefore obviously be True False True because when you do float(whatever) you are creating a new float object. a = (0 pynan) print a a[1] is pynan any([aa is pynan for aa in a]) I don't know what it is that you find surprising with this. a = array(( 0 NaN )) print a a[1] is NaN isnan( a[1] ) This I did have to run. :-) When you stick NaN into an array it's converted into a numpy.float64 object which is why a[1] is NaN fails. This all seems fairly unsurprising to me. But then I don't really know anything much about NumPy. :-)  NaN is not a singleton like None so you can't really use the is check on it. What makes it a bit tricky is that NaN == NaN is False as IEEE-754 requires. That's why you need to use the numpy.isnan() function to check if a float is not a number. Or the standard library math.isnan() if you're using Python 2.6+. Well it's in the definition of NaN. def isnan(x): return (x != x)  Not such a big gotcha: With boolean slicing I sometimes wish I could do x[ 3<= y < 7 ] like the python double comparison. Instead I have to write x[ np.logical_and( 3<=y y<7) ] (Unless you know something better?) Also np.logical_and and np.logical_or only take two arguments each I would like them to take a variable number or a list so I could feed in more than just two logical clauses. (numpy 1.3 maybe this has all changed in later versions.) What about x[(3<=y) & (y<7)] ?  from Neil Martinsen-Burrell in numpy-discussion 7 Sept -- The ndarray type available in Numpy is not conceptually an extension of Python's iterables. If you'd like to help other Numpy users with this issue you can edit the documentation in the online documentation editor at numpy-docs  I found the fact that multiplying up lists of elements just creates view of elements caught me out. >>> a=[0]*5 >>>a [00000] >>>a[2] = 1 >>>a [00100] >>>b = [np.ones(3)]*5 >>>b [array([ 1. 1. 1.]) array([ 1. 1. 1.]) array([ 1. 1. 1.]) array([ 1. 1. 1.]) array([ 1. 1. 1.])] >>>b[2][1] = 2 >>>b [array([ 1. 2. 1.]) array([ 1. 2. 1.]) array([ 1. 2. 1.]) array([ 1. 2. 1.]) array([ 1. 2. 1.])] So if you create a list of elements like this and intend to do different operations on them you are scuppered ... A straightforward solution is to iteratively create each of the arrays (using a 'for loop' or list comprehension) or use a higher dimensional array (where e.g. each of these 1D arrays is a row in your 2D array which is generally faster).  Because __eq__ does not return a bool using numpy arrays in any kind of containers prevents equality testing without a container-specific work around. Example: >>> import numpy >>> a = numpy.array(range(3)) >>> b = numpy.array(range(3)) >>> a == b array([ True True True] dtype=bool) >>> x = (a 'banana') >>> y = (b 'banana') >>> x == y Traceback (most recent call last): File ""<stdin>"" line 1 in <module> ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all() This is a horrible problem. For example you cannot write unittests for containers which use TestCase.assertEqual() and must instead write custom comparison functions. Suppose we write a work-around function special_eq_for_numpy_and_tuples. Now we can do this in a unittest: x = (array1 'deserialized') y = (array2 'deserialized') self.failUnless( special_eq_for_numpy_and_tuples(x y) ) Now we must do this for every container type we might use to store numpy arrays. Furthermore __eq__ might return a bool rather than an array of bools: >>> a = numpy.array(range(3)) >>> b = numpy.array(range(5)) >>> a == b False Now each of our container-specific equality comparison functions must also handle that special case. Maybe we can patch over this wart with a subclass? >>> class SaneEqualityArray (numpy.ndarray): ... def __eq__(self other): ... return isinstance(other SaneEqualityArray) and self.shape == other.shape and (numpy.ndarray.__eq__(self other)).all() ... >>> a = SaneEqualityArray( (2 3) ) >>> a.fill(7) >>> b = SaneEqualityArray( (2 3) ) >>> b.fill(7) >>> a == b True >>> x = (a 'banana') >>> y = (b 'banana') >>> x == y True >>> c = SaneEqualityArray( (7 7) ) >>> c.fill(7) >>> a == c False That seems to do the right thing. The class should also explicitly export elementwise comparison since that is often useful.  In [1]: bool([]) Out[1]: False In [2]: bool(array([])) Out[2]: False In [3]: bool([0]) Out[3]: True In [4]: bool(array([0])) Out[4]: False So don't test for the emptiness of an array by checking its truth value. Use size(array).  No one seems to have mentioned this so far: >>> all(False for i in range(3)) False >>> from numpy import all >>> all(False for i in range(3)) True >>> any(False for i in range(3)) False >>> from numpy import any >>> any(False for i in range(3)) True numpy's any and all don't play nicely with generators and don't raise any error warning you that they don't.  Slicing creates views not copies. >>> l = [1 2 3 4] >>> s = l[2:3] >>> s[0] = 5 >>> l [1 2 3 4] >>> a = array([1 2 3 4]) >>> s = a[2:3] >>> s[0] = 5 >>> a array([1 2 5 4]) not always: ""There are two kinds of fancy indexing in numpy which behave similarly ..."" http://mail.scipy.org/pipermail/numpy-discussion/2008-January/031101.html  (Related but a NumPy vs. SciPy gotcha rather than NumPy vs Python) Slicing beyond an array's real size works differently: >>> import numpy scipy.sparse >>> m = numpy.random.rand(2 5) # create a 2x5 dense matrix >>> print m[:3 :] # works like list slicing in Python: clips to real size [[ 0.12245393 0.20642799 0.98128601 0.06102106 0.74091038] [ 0.0527411 0.9131837 0.6475907 0.27900378 0.22396443]] >>> s = scipy.sparse.lil_matrix(m) # same for csr_matrix and other sparse formats >>> print s[:3 :] # doesn't clip! IndexError: row index out of bounds So when slicing scipy.sparse arrays you must make manually sure your slice bounds are within range. This differs from how both NumPy and plain Python work.  The truth value of a Numpy array differs from that of a python sequence type where any non-empty sequence is true. >>> import numpy as np >>> l = [0123] >>> a = np.arange(4) >>> if l: print ""Im true"" ...

But with a collection of numbers truth could reasonably mean ""all elements are non-zero"" or ""at least one element is non-zero"". Numpy refuses to guess which definition is meant and raises the above exception. Using the .any() and .all() methods allows one to specify which meaning of true is meant. >>> if a.any(): print ""Im true"" ... Im true >>> if a.all(): print ""Im true"" ... >>>  I think this one is funny: >>> import numpy as n >>> a = n.array([[12][34]]) >>> a[1] a[0] = a[0] a[1] >>> a array([[1 2] [1 2]]) For Python lists on the other hand this works as intended: >>> b = [[12][34]] >>> b[1] b[0] = b[0] b[1] >>> b [[3 4] [1 2]] Funny side note: numpy itself had a bug in the shuffle function because it used that notation :-) (see here).

I am thinking something like this: mysql_query(""INSERT INTO classifieds (classified_id ad_id poster_id cat_id area_id headline description) VALUES ($classified_id '$ad_id' $poster_id $cat_id $area_id '$headline' '$description')""); But I don't know where to take it from here... I think the posters table should not be like this because how should I determine what the poster_id should be? Or should I set it to auto-increment? Remember this posters may not log in or anything so there is no problem with one person having multiple poster_table records if you know what I mean. classified_id is a random unique value generated by PHP so that is always unique. Please guide me! I don't know how to link the tables together correctly. If you have any Q let me know and I will update this Q! category table: cat_id (PK) cat_name category_options table: option_id (PK) cat_id (FK) option_name option_values table: value_id (PK) option_id (FK) value classifieds table: classified_id (PK) ad_id (VARCHAR) something like ""Bmw330ci_28238239832"" which will appear in URL poster_id (FK) cat_id (FK) area_id (FK) headline description price etc.... posters table: poster_id (PK) name email tel password area table: area_id (PK) area community You've got the right idea already. When someone creates a post and enters their personal info FIRST insert the ""poster"" record into the posters table. The ""poster_id"" primary key for that table should be an auto_increment field. Next get the ID of the new poster you just created using PHP's ""mysql_insert_id"". That integer value will be the number you put in the ""poster_id"" foreign key field in the ""classifieds"" table. Structurally your database schema is looking pretty good.  You should usually set the primary key to an auto-increment field. When you have linked tables and you need to join on the id you can first insert into the main table and then use the function mysql_insert_id to retrieve the id of the element you just inserted. You can then insert into the other table using this value as the foreign key. This is a very standard way to do things so it should be fine for you. But I have a primary key in every table do they all have to be AI? They don't have to be but it's almost always a good idea to have the primary key as an auto-increment. One obvious exception is when you have an intermediate table then you only need the two foreign keys and no extra column for the primary key. I don't think you have such a table in your schema though so it doesn't matter. so in my case what would you set to primary? I mean the cat_id couldn't be PK right? because there are 15 categories I have which are constant (ie set by me non-changeable)... If you've defined some fixed ID's in your code then you can use those as a primary key but if there's any chance ever that you might have to change those ids then it wouldn't hurt to add an extra column with an auto-increment id as the PK and use that in all joins. Changing a PK once your system is live is a painful experience. You should avoid using a PK that might one day need to change.",php sql mysql database,2.69815723473439E-4,4.4001917507031295E-4,0.9989523961040394,3.3776899741677294E-4

1408311,NumPy array slice using None This had me scratching my head for a while. I was unintentionally slicing an array with None and getting something other than an error (I expected an error). Instead it returns an array with an extra dimension. >>> import numpy >>> a = numpy.arange(4).reshape(22) >>> a array([[0 1] [2 3]]) >>> a[None] array([[[0 1] [2 3]]]) Is this behavior intentional or a side-effect?

2523631,"SQL Select * from multiple tables Using PHP/PDO/MySQL is it possible to use a wildcard for the columns when a select is done on multiple tables and the returned array keys are fully qualified to avoid column name clash? example: SELECT * from table1 table2; gives: Array keys are 'table1.id' 'table2.id' 'table1.name' etc. I tried ""SELECT table1.*table2.* ..."" but the returned array keys were not fully qualified so columns with the same name clashed and were overwritten. So basically you are lazy? Too lazy to do your job correctly? beware of identically named coluns in different tables - you'll only get one instance. Yes. I did notice that if I knew the number of columns in each table I could retrieve values by the numeric index but thats not the case. Is there a specific reason you need to do this? It's usually a bad idea to use SELECT * from multiple tables anyway so I'm just trying to figure out the thought process behind you doing this before I give you an answer. Agreed. Unless you don't know the column names (and I bet you do) SELECT * is never a good idea: you're running two queries instead of one (one for the column names then your query) and you're most likely bringing back more data than you need. Might not notice a problem now but if some of those fields are BLOBs or have a lot of text you will. @Stephen I have several 'content' tables with unrelated columns and one 'metadata' table that holds similar data for the other tables. I query one content table with the metadata table (lets say one to one relationship) for all the content table columns. I wish could explain better but my database lingo is limited. @Tom Of course I know the column names. Just don't want to type them out! Yes you can. The easiest way is with pdo although there's at least a few other extensions which are capable of it. pdo Set the attribute on the PDO object not the PDOStatment. $PDO->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_FETCH_TABLE_NAMES true); That's it. Then you get associative array keys like myTable.myColumn. It works if you fetch an object too so beware because you need to access the properties like $obj->{'myTable.myColumn'}; *The manual says that attribute is only supported by certain drivers. If the above doesn't work this might work instead. $pdoStatement->setFetchMode(PDO::FETCH_NUM); $pdoStatement->execute(); //build our associative array keys $qualifiedColumnNames = array(); for ($i = 0; $i < $pdoStatement->columnCount(); $i++) { $columnMeta = $pdoStatement->getColumnMeta($i); $qualifiedColumnNames[] = ""$columnMeta[table].$columnMeta[name]""; } //fetch results and combine with keys while ($row = $pdoStatement->fetch()) { $qualifiedRow = array_combine($qualifiedColumnNames $row); print_r($qualifiedRow); } Same basic pattern is used for other database extensions mysql $res = mysql_query($sql); //build our associative array keys $qualifiedColumnNames = array(); for ($i = 0; $i < mysql_num_fields($res); $i++) { $columnMeta = mysql_fetch_field($res $i); $qualifiedColumnNames[] = ""$columnMeta[table].$columnMeta[name]""; } //fetch results and combine with keys while ($row = mysql_fetch_row($res)) { $qualifiedRow = array_combine($qualifiedColumnNames $row); print_r($qualifiedRow); } mysqli $res = $mysqli->query($sql); //build our associative array keys $qualifiedColumnNames = array(); foreach ($res->fetch_fields() as $columnMeta) { $qualifiedColumnNames[] = ""{$columnMeta->table}.{$columnMeta->name}""; } //fetch results and combine with keys while ($row = $res->fetch_row()) { $qualifiedRow = array_combine($qualifiedColumnNames $row); print_r($qualifiedRow); } Dude that worked. Thanks. This is an awesome work around you saved my bacon.  Unfortunately no; there is no SQL syntax for ensuring that column names are unique. If you truly don't know the names of the columns and must use SELECT * your only real option would be to revert to some very ugly looking dynamic SQL that could inspect the structure of the tables and generate a query that would select them all explicitly with a table-name prefix. I don't know which RDBMS you're using but something like this should work on SQL Server: declare @columns table (idx int identity(11) tablename varchar(100) columnname varchar(100)) insert into @columns (tablename columnname) select tablename columnname from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS where tablename in ('table_1' 'table_2') declare @sql nvarchar(4000) declare @i int declare @cnt in declare @col varchar(100) declare @table varchar(100) select @i = 0 @cnt = max(idx) @sql = '' from @columns while @i < @cnt begin select @i = @i + 1 select @col = columnname @table = tablename from @columns where idx = @i if len(@sql) > 0 select @sql = @sql + ' ' select @sql = @sql + '[' + @table + '].[' + @col + '] as [' + @table + '_' + @col + ']' end select @sql = 'select ' + @sql + ' from table_1 table_2' exec sp_executesql @sql By the time I write that I could have written the sql queries by hand. Hang on... I could have done that instead of being here. Joking. I don't know which language/db/library but I do remember having to work with fully qualified column names and hating to type the full column name. Now I have the reverse problem. @zaf: I've essentially written it for you... Nice try but using MySQL. @zaf: Then adapt it. What you're looking for isn't strictly possible. I've provided you with something that will at least *accomplish* what you're looking for even if it's less than ideal.  Unfortunately PHP (particularly the MySQL PgSQL MSSQL extensions) will always have your columns overwrite in the case of overlap. I would recommend creating a View in your database and Alias your columns so that they are ""fully-qualified"". For example: (MySQL) CREATE VIEW viewTable1Table2 AS SELECT t1.field1 AS Table1Field1 t2.field1 AS Table2Field1 FROM Table1 t1 INNER JOIN Table2 t2 ON t1.id = t2.id; The syntax may not be perfect but you can get a general idea of what I am talking about. Didn't know about that but still the same problem.  you can do this: SELECT Table1.*Table2.xyz Table2.abc... From... where you get all columns from one table using ""*"" and then just the columns from the other table you need so there is no clash. You could also use column aliases where you ""rename"" a column: SELECT Table1.A AS T1_ATable2.A AS T2_A... From... your result set would be of columns T1_A and T2_A Firstly you are specifying the column names - we don't know the columns and what if xyz or abc are also in Table1?. Secondly as I said I've tried the wildcard. If we don't know the columns in the tables then its just a tad more difficult to rename them. how can you not know the columns? is this generated with dynamic SQL? if so dynamically build the select list. The tables involved are dynamic. I'm trying to avoid writing code that handles each 'type' of table. @zaf if you don't know the column names how do you know which ones you need/ which ones are being overwritten? @Tom And thats the puzzle. If the column name included the table name we would be ok.",php sql mysql database pdo,1.0778181418671167E-4,1.7577205789004845E-4,0.9141038445980842,0.08561260152983897

From Numpy Documentation np.delete(arr obj axis=None) Return a new array with sub-arrays along an axis deleted. >>> arr array([[ 1 2 3 4] [ 5 6 7 8] [ 9 10 11 12]]) >>> np.delete(arr 1 0) array([[ 1 2 3 4] [ 9 10 11 12]]) >>> np.delete(arr np.s_[::2] 1) array([[ 2 4] [ 6 8] [10 12]]) >>> np.delete(arr [135] None) array([ 1 3 5 7 8 9 10 11 12])  Another way is to use masked arrays: import numpy as np a = np.array([[ np.nan 2. 3. np.nan] [ 1. 2. 3. 9]]) print(a) # [[ NaN 2. 3. NaN] # [ 1. 2. 3. 9.]] The np.ma.masked_invalid method returns a masked array with nans and infs masked out: print(np.ma.masked_invalid(a)) [[-- 2.0 3.0 --] [1.0 2.0 3.0 9.0]] The np.ma.compress_cols method returns a 2-D array with any column containing a masked value suppressed: a=np.ma.compress_cols(np.ma.masked_invalid(a)) print(a) # [[ 2. 3.] # [ 2. 3.]] See manipulating-a-maskedarray  This creates another array without those columns:  b = a.compress(logical_not(z) axis=1) cool. I wish matlab's syntax worked here: ""a(:z) = []"" is much simpler similar: b = a[:[12]] @bpowah: indeed. the more general way would be b = a[:z]. You might want to update your answer accordingly  Given its name I think the standard way should be delete: A = scipy.delete(A 1 0) # delete second row of A B = scipy.delete(B 2 0) # delete third row of B C = scipy.delete(C 1 1) # delete second column of C  In your situation you can extract the desired data with: a[: -z] ""-z"" is the logical negation of the boolean array ""z"".

1401712,"How can the euclidean distance be calculated with numpy? I have two points in 3D: (xa ya za) (xb yb zb) And I want to calculate the distance: dist = sqrt((xa-xb)^2 + (ya-yb)^2 + (za-zb)^2) What's the best way to do this with Numpy or with Python in general? I have: a = numpy.array((xa ya za)) b = numpy.array((xb yb zb)) Another instance of this problem solving method. As soon as I submitted the question I got it: def dist(xy): return numpy.sqrt(numpy.sum((x-y)**2)) a = numpy.array((xayaza)) b = numpy.array((xbybzb)) dist_a_b = dist(ab) can you use numpy's sqrt and/or sum implementations? That should make it faster (?). Thanks! I'll update the answer I found this on the other side of the interwebs `norm = lambda x: N.sqrt(N.square(x).sum())` ; `norm(x-y)` scratch that. it had to be somewhere. here it is: `numpy.linalg.norm(x-y)`  Can be done like this don't know how fast it is but its no numpy. from math import sqrt a = (123) #data point 1 b = (456) #data point 2 print sqrt(sum( (a - b)**2 for a b in zip(a b)))  I find a 'dist' function in matplotlib.mlab but i don't think it's handy enough. I'm posting it here just for reference. import numpy as np import matplotlib as plt a = np.array([123]) b = np.array([234]) # distance between a and b dis = plt.mlab.dist(ab)  Use numpy.linalg.norm: dist = numpy.linalg.norm(a-b) I knew there was a reason for me not to accept my own answer :-). Just for the record I managed to see Mark Lavin's answer before he deleted it. I liked it better for the link to Python's docs and the explanation. Can you add some details? The linalg.norm docs can be found here: http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.norm.html My only real comment was sort of pointing out the connection between a norm (in this case the Frobenius norm/2-norm which is the default for norm function) and a metric (in this case Euclidean distance).  There's a function for that in SciPy it's called Euclidean example: from scipy.spatial import distance a = (123) b = (456) dst = distance.euclidean(ab)  dist = numpy.linalg.norm(a-b) Is a nice one line answer. However if speed is a concern I would recommend experimenting on your machine. I found that using the math library's sqrt with the ** operator for the square is much faster on my machine than the one line numpy solution. I ran my tests using this simple program: #!/usr/bin/python import math import numpy from random import uniform def fastest_calc_dist(p1p2): return math.sqrt((p2[0] - p1[0]) ** 2 + (p2[1] - p1[1]) ** 2 + (p2[2] - p1[2]) ** 2) def math_calc_dist(p1p2): return math.sqrt(math.pow((p2[0] - p1[0]) 2) + math.pow((p2[1] - p1[1]) 2) + math.pow((p2[2] - p1[2]) 2)) def numpy_calc_dist(p1p2): return numpy.linalg.norm(numpy.array(p1)-numpy.array(p2)) TOTAL_LOCATIONS = 1000 p1 = dict() p2 = dict() for i in range(0 TOTAL_LOCATIONS): p1[i] = (uniform(01000)uniform(01000)uniform(01000)) p2[i] = (uniform(01000)uniform(01000)uniform(01000)) total_dist = 0 for i in range(0 TOTAL_LOCATIONS): for j in range(0 TOTAL_LOCATIONS): dist = fastest_calc_dist(p1[i] p2[j]) #change this line for testing total_dist += dist print total_dist On my machine math_calc_dist runs much faster than numpy_calc_dist: 1.5 seconds versus 23.5 seconds. To get a measurable difference between fastest_calc_dist and math_calc_dist I had to up TOTAL_LOCATIONS to 6000. Then fastest_calc_dist takes ~50 seconds while math_calc_dist takes ~60 seconds. You can also experiment with numpy.sqrt and numpy.square though both were slower than the math alternatives on my machine. My tests were run with Python 2.6.6. You're badly misunderstanding how to use numpy... _Don't_ use loops or list comprehensions. If you're iterating through and applying the function to _each_ item then yeah the numpy functions will be slower. The whole point is to vectorize things. If I move the numpy.array call into the loop where I am creating the points I do get better results with numpy_calc_dist but it is still 10x slower than fastest_calc_dist. If I have that many points and I need to find the distance between each pair I'm not sure what else I can do to advantage numpy. I realize this thread is old but I just want to reinforce what Joe said. You are not using numpy correctly. What you are calculating is the sum of the distance from every point in p1 to every point in p2. The solution with numpy/scipy is over 70 times quicker on my machine. Make p1 and p2 into an array (even using a loop if you have them defined as dicts). Then you can get the total sum in one step `scipy.spatial.distance.cdist(p1 p2).sum()`. That is it. Or use `numpy.linalg.norm(p1-p2).sum()` to get the sum between each point in p1 and the corresponding point in p2 (i.e. not every point in p1 to every point in p2). And if you do want every point in p1 to every point in p2 and don't want to use scipy as in my previous comment then you can use np.apply_along_axis along with numpy.linalg.norm to still do it much much quicker then your ""fastest"" solution. Previous versions of NumPy had very slow norm implementations. In current versions there's no need for all this.  You can just substract the vectors and then innerproduct. Following your example a = numpy.array((xayaza)) b = numpy.array((xbybzb)) tmp = a - b result = numpy.dot( tmp.T  tmp) Simple Code an easy to understand. this will give me the square of the distance. you're missing a sqrt here.",python numpy euclidean-distance,1.4756211658075883E-4,2.406463195458906E-4,2.0569754805784452E-4,0.9994060940158156

Thanks. if ($word_of_the_day) { $wotd = $wpdb->get_results(""SELECT termdefinition FROM glossary WHERE term = '{$word_of_the_day}'""); foreach ($wotd as $term) { } } elseif ($_COOKIE['WOTD']) { $word_of_the_day = htmlspecialchars(addslashes($_COOKIE['WOTD'])); $wotd = $wpdb->get_results(""SELECT termdefinition FROM glossary WHERE term = '{$word_of_the_day}'""); foreach ($wotd as $term) { } } else { $wotd = $wpdb->get_results(""SELECT termdefinition FROM glossary ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 1""); foreach ($wotd as $term) { setcookie(""WOTD"" $term->term time()+86400); } } Where does $word_of_the_day come from? If it comes from user input you are open to SQL injection.  One of the safest ways is to use the PDO MySQL functions which implements parameters: $db = new PDO('mysql:host=hostname;dbname=defaultDbName' 'username' 'password'); $stmt = $db->prepare('SELECT termdefinition FROM glossary WHERE term = :wotd'); if ($stmt) { if ($stmt->execute(array(':wotd' => $word_of_the_day))) { //This is safe for any input method $info = $stmt->fetchAll(); foreach($info as $row) { //Whatever } } } The PDO drivers does the correct escaping / quoting according to the data type in the table.  You should check out mysql_real_escape_string: ""Escapes special characters in a string for use in a SQL statement"". You don't have to do the stuff that you're doing with htmlspecialchars and addslashes manually. Are you familiar with SQL injection security risks? If the variable that you're including in the SELECT statement $word_of_the_day comes from the user then you have a potential SQL injection problem.  Well if $word_for_the_day comes from user input there's your first problem. Do this before you use it: $word_for_the_day = mysql_real_escape_string($word_for_the_day); Your cookie actually looks OK. The htmlspecialchars() and addslashes() calls in the context you're using them don't appear vulnerable to SQL injection or XSS attacks.  Another option you could consider would be to store the id of the word instead of the word itself in the cookie. That way it can only ever be an integer. Of course using the word is fine too as long as you mysql_real_escape_string it first I just wanted to offer another option.  addslashes is extremely weak. First thing run everything you query from the db through mysql_escape_string to prevent sql injection. That's just the basics. if($word_of_the_day){ $word_of_the_day = mysql_escape_string($word_of_the_day); $wotd = $wpdb->get_results (""SELECT termdefinition FROM glossary WHERE term = '{$word_of_the_day}'""); Also cookies in general aren't very secure no matter how secure code you write. For a much more secure solution I recommend you use PHP sessions ($_SESSION).

Sorry but after thorough investigation I can't find any way to perform the task you require without a minimum of post-processing (to strip off the trailing zeros you don't want to see); something like: import re ut0 = re.compile(r'(\d)0+$') thelist = [ut0.sub(r'\1' ""%12f"" % x) for x in a] print '\n'.join(thelist) is speedy and concise but breaks your constraint of being ""off-the-shelf"" -- it is instead a modular combination of general formatting (which almost does what you want but leaves trailing zero you want to hide) and a RE to remove undesired trailing zeros. Practically I think it does exactly what you require but your conditions as stated are I believe over-constrained. Edit: original question was edited to specify more significant digits require no extra leading space beyond what's required for the largest number and provide a new example (where my previous suggestion above doesn't match the desired output). The work of removing leading whitespace that's common to a bunch of strings is best performed with textwrap.dedent -- but that works on a single string (with newlines) while the required output is a list of strings. No problem we'll just put the lines together dedent them and split them up again: import re import textwrap a = [ 5.50056103e+02 6.77383566e+03 6.01001513e+05 3.55425142e+08 7.07254875e+05 8.83174744e+02 8.22320510e+01 4.25076609e+08 6.28662635e+07 1.56503068e+02] thelist = textwrap.dedent( '\n'.join(ut0.sub(r'\1' ""%20f"" % x) for x in a)).splitlines() print '\n'.join(thelist) emits:  550.056103 6773.83566 601001.513 355425142.0 707254.875 883.174744 82.232051 425076609.0 62866263.5 156.503068 I can't guarantee that %12f won't lose significant digits. (I made an edit and changed the way my test arrays are generated to reflect this.) If I increase to %20 or more to guarantee this then there is simply too much padding to the left. (want the largest value to have no leading spaces) I'll take back-of-the-cupboard solutions too!  Pythons string formatting can both print out only the necessary decimals (with %g) or use a fixed set of decimals (with %f). However you want to print out only the necessary decimals except if the number is a whole number then you want one decimal and that makes it complex. This means you would end up with something like: def printarr(arr): for x in array: if math.floor(x) == x: res = '%.1f' % x else: res = '%.10g' % x print ""%*s"" % (15-res.find('.')+len(res) res) This will first create a string either with 1 decimal if the value is a whole number or it will print with automatic decimals (but only up to 10 numbers) if it is not a fractional number. Lastly it will print it adjusted so that the decimal point will be aligned. Probably though numpy actually does what you want because you typically do want it to be in exponential mode if it's too long.",python formatting numpy code-golf,2.50568653190224E-4,4.0863078939910397E-4,0.10735048300035674,0.8919903175570538
112603,"What is 'JNI Global reference' I am using jProfiler to find memory leaks in a Java swing application. I have identified instances of a JFrame which keeps growing in count. This frame is opened and then closed. Using jProfiler and viewing the Paths to GC Root there is only one reference 'JNI Global reference'. What does this mean? Why is it hanging on to each instance of the frame? A JNI global reference is a reference from ""native"" code to a Java object managed by the Java garbage collector. Its purpose is to prevent collection of an object that is still in use by native code but doesn't appear to have any live references in the Java code. A JFrame is a java.awt.Window and is associated with a ""native"" Window object. When you are completely finished with a particular JFrame instance you should invoke its dispose() method to clean up. I am not sure if any native code is creating a global reference to the JFrame but it seems likely. If it does this will prevent the JFrame from being garbage collected. If you are creating many Windows (or subclasses) and seeing that they are never collected make sure that they are disposed. If the code is only Java this is the most likely explanation. I've had problems with global pointers but I've been working with JNI.  Wikipedia has a good overview of Java Native Interface essentially it allows communication between Java and native operating system libraries writen in other languages. JNI global references are prone to memory leaks as they are not automatically garbage collected and the programmer must explicitly free them. If you are not writing any JNI code yourself it is possible that the library you are using has a memory leak. edit here is a bit more info on local vs. global references and why global references are used (and how they should be freed) Wikipedia is a secondary source.

95767,"How can I catch AWT thread exceptions in Java? We'd like a trace in our application logs of these exceptions - by default Java just outputs them to the console. There is a distinction between uncaught exceptions in the EDT and outside the EDT. Another question has a solution for both but if you want just the EDT portion chewed up... class AWTExceptionHandler { public void handle(Throwable t) { try { // insert your exception handling code here // or do nothing to make it go away } catch (Throwable t) { // don't let the exception get thrown out will cause infinite looping! } } public static void registerExceptionHandler() { System.setProperty('sun.awt.exception.handler' AWTExceptionHandler.class.getName()) } } Three years old but still a very useful answer. Thanks! No need to catch throwable. There will be no infinite looping. java.awt.EventDispatchThread.handleException is catching any exceptions for you. There saids `classs AWTExceptionHandler`  There are two ways: /* Install a Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler on the EDT */ Set a system property: System.setProperty(""sun.awt.exception.handler""MyExceptionHandler.class.getName()); I don't know if the latter works on non-SUN jvms. -- Indeed the first is not correct it's only a mechanism for detecting a crashed thread. Using Thread.UncaufhtExceptionHandler won't catch EDT exceptions. The EDT class catches all throwables and prints them out rather than letting them unwind the whole thread. You are also missing details about what is needed in the second option the MyExceptionHandler class must have a handle(Throwable) instance method accessable and a no-args constructor accessable.  A little addition to shemnons anwer: The first time an uncaught RuntimeException (or Error) occurs in the EDT it is looking for the property ""sun.awt.exception.handler"" and tries to load the class associated with the property. EDT needs the Handler class to have a default constructor otherwise the EDT will not use it. If you need to bring a bit more dynamics into the handling story you are forced to do this with static operations because the class is instantiated by the EDT and therefore has no chance to access other resources other than static. Here is the exception handler code from our Swing framework we are using. It was written for Java 1.4 and it worked quite fine there: public class AwtExceptionHandler { private static final Logger LOGGER = LoggerFactory.getLogger(AwtExceptionHandler.class); private static List exceptionHandlerList = new LinkedList(); /** * WARNING: Don't change the signature of this method! */ public void handle(Throwable throwable) { if (exceptionHandlerList.isEmpty()) { LOGGER.error(""Uncatched Throwable detected"" throwable); } else { delegate(new ExceptionEvent(throwable)); } } private void delegate(ExceptionEvent event) { for (Iterator handlerIterator = exceptionHandlerList.iterator(); handlerIterator.hasNext();) { IExceptionHandler handler = (IExceptionHandler) handlerIterator.next(); try { handler.handleException(event); if (event.isConsumed()) { break; } } catch (Throwable e) { LOGGER.error(""Error while running exception handler: "" + handler e); } } } public static void addErrorHandler(IExceptionHandler exceptionHandler) { exceptionHandlerList.add(exceptionHandler); } public static void removeErrorHandler(IExceptionHandler exceptionHandler) { exceptionHandlerList.remove(exceptionHandler); } } Hope it helps.",java swing exception-handling awt,0.011692242840556566,0.9875653593247714,3.911380811746509E-4,3.512597534972923E-4
237899,"How to draw a filled envelop like a cone on OpenGL (using GLUT)? I am using freeglut for opengl rendering... I need to draw an envelop looking like a cone (2D) that has to be filled with some color and some transparency applied. Is the freeglut toolkit equipped with such an inbuilt functionality to draw filled geometries(or some trick)? or is there some other api that has an inbuilt support for filled up geometries.. Edit1: just to clarify the 2D cone thing... the envelop is the graphical interpretation of the coverage area of an aircraft during interception(of an enemy aircraft)...that resembles a sector of a circle..i should have mentioned sector instead.. and glutSolidCone doesnot help me as i want to draw a filled sector of a circle...which i have already done...what remains to do is to fill it with some color... how to fill geometries with color in opengl? Edit2: All the answers posted to this questions can work for my problem in a way.. But i would definitely would want to know a way how to fill a geometry with some color. Say if i want to draw an envelop which is a parabola...in that case there would be no default glut function to actually draw a filled parabola(or is there any?).. So to generalise this question...how to draw a custom geometry in some solid color? Edit3: The answer that mstrobl posted works for GL_TRIANGLES but for such a code: glBegin(GL_LINE_STRIP); glColor3f(0.0 0.0 1.0); glVertex3f(0.0 0.0 0.0); glColor3f(0.0 0.0 1.0); glVertex3f(200.0 0.0 0.0); glColor3f(0.0 0.0 1.0); glVertex3f(200.0 200.0 0.0); glColor3f(0.0 0.0 1.0); glVertex3f(0.0 200.0 0.0); glColor3f(0.0 0.0 1.0); glVertex3f(0.0 0.0 0.0); glEnd(); which draws a square...only a wired square is drawn...i need to fill it with blue color. anyway to do it? if i put some drawing commands for a closed curve..like a pie..and i need to fill it with a color is there a way to make it possible... i dont know how its possible for GL_TRIANGLES... but how to do it for any closed curve? just to clarify the 2D cone thing... the envelop is the graphical interpretation of the coverage area of an aircraft during interception(of an enemy aircraft)...that resembles a sector of a circle..i should have mentioned sector instead.. Edit yoru comment into question because it's where it belongs. edited my original question..as i am newbie to stackoverflow i thought that followups to orig questions should go into comments.. is this how stackoverflow works? if the original poster feels to add to the conversation..how he should proceed?through comments/answering to own question or editing ques Since you reclarified your question to ask for a pie: there's an easy way to draw that too using opengl primitives: You'd draw a solid sphere using gluSolidSphere(). However since you only want to draw part of it you just clip the unwanted parts away: void glClipPlane(GLenum plane const GLdouble * equation); With plane being GL_CLIPPLANE0 to GL_CLIPPLANEn and equation being a plane equation in normal form (a*x + b*y + c*z + d = 0 would mean equation would hold the values { a b c d }. Please note that those are doubles and not floats.  On the edit on colors: OpenGL is actually a state machine. This means that the current material and/or color position is used when drawing. Since you probably won't be using materials ignore that for now. You want colors. glColor3f(float r float g float b) // draw with r/g/b color and alpha of 1 glColor4f(float r float g float b float alpha) This will affect the colors of any vertices you draw of any geometry you render - be it glu's or your own - after the glColorXX call has been executed. If you draw a face with vertices and change the color inbetween the glVertex3f/glVertex2f calls the colors are interpolated. Try this: glBegin(GL_TRIANGLES); glColor3f(0.0 0.0 1.0); glVertex3f(-3.0 0.0 0.0); glColor3f(0.0 1.0 0.0); glVertex3f(0.0 3.0 0.0); glColor3f(1.0 0.0 0.0); glVertex3f(3.0 0.0 0.0); glEnd(); But I pointed at glColor4f already so I assume you want to set the colors on a per-vertex basis. And you want to render using display lists. Just like you can display lists of vertices you can also make them have a list of colors: all you need to do is enable the color lists and tell opengl where the list resides. Of course they need to have the same outfit as the vertex list (same order). If you had glEnableClientState(GL_VERTEX_ARRAY); glVertexPointer(3 GL_FLOAT 0 vertices_); glDisableClientState(GL_VERTEX_ARRAY); you should add colors this way. They need not be float; in fact you tell it what format it should be. For a color list with 1 byte per channel and 4 channels (R G B and A) use this: glEnableClientState(GL_VERTEX_ARRAY); glEnableClientState(GL_COLOR_ARRAY); glVertexPointer(3 GL_FLOAT 0 vertices_); glColorPointer(4 GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE 0 colors_); glDisableClientState(GL_COLOR_ARRAY); glDisableClientState(GL_VERTEX_ARRAY); EDIT: Forgot to add that you then have to tell OpenGL which elements to draw by calling glDrawElements.  On Edit3: The way I understand your question is that you want to have OpenGL draw borders and anything between them should be filled with colors. The idea you had was right but a line strip is just that - a strip of lines and it does not have any area. You can however have the lines connect to each other to define a polygon. That will fill out the area of the polygon on a per-vertex basis. Adapting your code: glBegin(GL_POLYGON); glColor3f(0.0 0.0 1.0); glVertex3f(0.0 0.0 0.0); glColor3f(0.0 0.0 1.0); glVertex3f(200.0 0.0 0.0); glColor3f(0.0 0.0 1.0); glVertex3f(200.0 200.0 0.0); glColor3f(0.0 0.0 1.0); glVertex3f(0.0 200.0 0.0); glColor3f(0.0 0.0 1.0); glVertex3f(0.0 0.0 0.0); glEnd(); Please note however that drawing a polygon this way has two limitations: The polygon must be convex. This is a slow operation. But I assume you just want to get the job done and this will do it. For the future you might consider just triangulating your polygon. Note that you don't need the multiple glColor3f() statements. OpenGL is a state machine and the state is retained. So one glColor3f()-statement will suffice. ThankYou mstroblthis is really what i wanted...ur solution made my day!  I'm not sure what you mean by ""an envelop"" but a cone is a primitive that glut has: glutSolidCone(radius height number_of_slices number_of_stacks) The easiest way to fill it with color is to draw it with color. Since you want to make it somewhat transparent you need an alpha value too: glColor4f(float red float green float blue float alpha) // rgb and alpha run from 0.0f to 1.0f; in the example here alpha of 1.0 will // mean no transparency 0.0 total transparency. Call before drawing. To render translucently blending has to be enabled. And you must set the blending function to use. What you want to do will probably be achieved with the following. If you want to learn more drop me a comment and I will look for some good pointers. But here goes your setup: glEnable(GL_BLEND); glBlendFunc(GL_SRC_ALPHA GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA); Call that before doing any drawing operations possibly at program initialization. :) I never remember those blending parameters.  I remember there was a subroutine for that. But it's neither too hard to do by yourself. But I don't understand the 2D -thing. Cone in 2D? Isn't it just a triangle? Anyway here's an algorithm to drawing a cone in opengl First take a circle subdivision it evenly so that you get a nice amount of edges. Now pick the center of the circle make triangles from the edges to the center of the circle. Then select a point over the circle and make triangles from the edges to that point. The size shape and orientation depends about the values you use to generate the circle and two points. Every step is rather simple and shouldn't cause trouble for you. First just subdivision a scalar value. Start from [0-2] -range. Take the midpoint ((start+end)/2) and split the range with it. Store the values as pairs. For instance subdividing once should give you: [(01) (12)] Do this recursively couple of times then calculate what those points are on the circle. Simple trigonometry just remember to multiply the values with �� before proceeding. After this you have a certain amount of edges. 2^n where n is the amount of subdivisions. Then you can simply turn them into triangles by giving them one vertex point more. Amount of triangles ends up being therefore: 2^(n+1). (The amounts are useful to know if you are doing it with fixed size arrays. Edit: What you really want is a pie. (Sorry the pun) It's equally simple to render. You can again use just triangles. Just select scalar range [-0.25 - 0.25] subdivide project to circle and generate one set of triangles. The scalar - circle projection is simple as: x=cos(v*pi)r y=sin(vpi)*r where (xy) is the resulting vertex point r is a radius and trigonometric functions work on radiances not degrees. (if they work with degrees replace pi with 180) Use vertex buffers or lists to render it yourself. Edit: About the coloring question. glColor4f if you want some parts of the geometry to be different by its color you can assign a color for each vertex in vertex buffer itself.

Is this a reference to void cast as an unsigned short pointer and then offset by (3*mesh(etc...) + batchNum)? It's breaking my brain. It's found in the context of a glDrawElements call: glDrawElements(GL_TRIANGLES i32Tris * 3 GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT &((unsigned short*)0)[3 * mesh.sBoneBatches.pnBatchOffset[batchNum]]); It's found in the context of a glDrawElements call: glDrawElements(GL_TRIANGLES i32Tris * 3 GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT &((unsigned short*)0)[3 * mesh.sBoneBatches.pnBatchOffset[batchNum]]); Its an obfuscated way of computing sizeof(unsigned short) * 3 * mesh.sBoneBatches.pnBatchOffset[batchNum] but since it doesn't actually save any characters its not a very good obfuscation Only one caveat - it returns a pointer to address N not N as a number.  It's computing a byte offset -- 3 * mesh.sBoneBatches.pnBatchOffset[batchNum] is the index. Using 0 as the pointer means that the address will be just the offset value nothing else. In essence it's `3 * mesh.sBoneBatches.pnBatchOffset[batchNum] * sizeof(unsigned short)` (though with a different type) assuming that `unsigned short[]` arrays are aligned naturally with no padding. I dont get it . Shouldn't ""((unsigned short*)0)[...]"" dereference a null pointer thus leading in unexpected behavior ? @TheSamFrom1984: No because dereferencing is not needed to take the address. This is a common trick in C and is theoretically illegal in C++ but generally works anyways.  Let's go from the inside out. (unsigned short*)0 This is casting 0 to an unsigned short pointer. This will be used for computing a memory offset computed in terms of the size of an unsigned short. 3 * mesh.sBoneBatches.pnBatchOffset[batchNum] This is presumably the offset in memory of some batch of triangles. A triangle is composed of 3 shorts so it looks like they are storing an offset in terms of numbers of triangles and then multiplying by 3 to get the number of shorts. ((unsigned short*)0)[3 * mesh.sBoneBatches.pnBatchOffset[batchNum]] This is now using that 0 pointer to find the memory location of the given offset. This would normally return the value of that memory location but they want a pointer to pass into glDrawElements so the use the & operator to get a pointer to that memory location: &((unsigned short*)0)[3 * mesh.sBoneBatches.pnBatchOffset[batchNum]] why isn't the applicaiton crashing at step 3 ? (attempt to get the value of a bad memory location) Because of the & operator the value is never accessed. Just the address of the value. It didn't know about this particularity of the language. Doesn't seem ""natural"" to me. Thanks. That was very helpful thank you. One more question is a 0 pointer the same concept as a void pointer? No but C mandates that the NULL pointer converts to an integral 0 and vice versa and C++ mandates that NULL is represented by 0.  Really this kind of hack is due to OpenGL expressing offsets inside Buffer Objects through the pointer argument of glDrawElements. glDrawElements(mode count type void* indices) indices represents either a client-side memory pointer or a server-side memory offset based on the binding of GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER_ARB It's interesting to dig a bit deeper...

3024265,Expand my knowledge in DB programming my name is Tal Im working on a PHP Application the should have lots and lots of records what DB should I use and are there guides on the web that explains how to build efficient dbs and tables? Tnx! Don't select every row (*) just select what you need in a query. Always close connections. Use either prepared statements or escape inputted user information when inserting or updating. `(*)` refers to columns not rows. Closing (non persistent) connections is useless. sorry kemp you carn't always be right like I guess you are all the time.  This is a big topic merely selecting technology A or B is not enough. You have to consider the whole chain from the end user all the way up to the web server. Most DB's are close performance wise. How well you utilise each DB will have a direct and bigger impact than simply using one platform over another. A badly designed DB schema and poorly optimised query will perform badly in ANY db platform.  Get familiar with database normalization. It's a brilliant theory that will help you build stable and scalable databases. There is a good article on the subject at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization As to what database management system you should use I'd recommend that you start with MySQL. It's the world's most popular database software (it's what they use in WordPress phpBB and Drupal). It's fast reliable open source and there are plenty of learning materials about it. I got a kick out of the edit history for this answer. +1 I know :) Sometimes I lose control.  MySql is easy to use but probably not the most efficient b/c it is free. SQLite works well too if you need an embedded database in your app.  PHP is widely used with MySql. You can also use PHP with sqlite. sqlite is faster and embeddable but is not ideal for large dbs.

Your title needs editing to be in English. Hola Ricardo el t�_tulo en ingl�s por favor. :-) I have no idea what the question is about I hope I translated correctly :) hello excuse was a mistake not happen again Try converting one of the arrays A or C into an array of floats. For instance: A = A * 1.0 Then the division will be floating point division.  Numpy arrays may have different types. You may also create a float array it will always divide correctly: >>> A = numpy.array ([[123] [456] [789]] dtype=float) >>> A/2 array([[ 0.5 1.  1.5] [ 2.  2.5 3. ] [ 3.5 4.  4.5]]) Notice the dtype= argument to numpy.array  To avoid integer division use numpy.true_divide(AC). You can also put from __future__ import division at the top of the file to default to this behavior. thanks for response,python numpy,7.204342981936541E-4,0.0011748941147780734,0.0449542008111968,0.9531504707758315

What is the best way to do this (according to performance)? So far I tried this: 1) Select all locations with value which is present more than once in the table: SELECT locationvalue FROM data_table WHERE value IN (SELECT value FROM data_table GROUP BY value HAVING COUNT(value) > 1); 2) Now I would like to filter the result using the neighbour_table but how? Using JOIN? Or another derived table (subquery)? I think about using PHP to do the job but how about the performance? Anyway I would like to see the SQL solution if there is one. Thanks in advance You could use a join to look up the value for both neighbours. Then you can select neighbours with the same value using a where clause: select n.* from neighbour_table n join data_table d1 on d1.location = n.location1 join data_table d2 on d2.location = n.location2 where d1.value = d2.value That's it?

3931002,"Should I use sessions for ""LOGINS"" on my site? I have a classifieds website where anyone (no need for login currently) can post a classified. It is PHP based. The procedure for posting is currently like this: click on ""New Classified"" ---> fill in a form of all information and hit ""View classified before publishing it"" ---> the form submits to a ""verify classifieds"" page where users verify their inputs ---> If everything is okay in the ""verify"" page then the user hits OK and the classified is published. The above procedure isn't exactly optimized. The first page (new_classified) where the form is is pretty good but the second page (verify) uses x number of hidden inputs in another form used to contain the previous pages form inputs. Now you know how it works on my site. The issue today is that alot of companies want to publish their classifieds and alot of classifieds at the same time. This means they have to fill out the form again and again currently. I am thinking about creating a login for companies only so that their information is automatically inputted into the form so all they would have to do is fill out the specific classified details like ""headline"" and ""description"" etc. How should I do this in my case? Sessions? This means I will have to create a new MySql table (I use MySql mainly) and store company-profiles there. So do you think converting to sessions is alot of work? Worth it? More reliable? I have never used sessions so I wouldn't know. As a last note you should know that I use a picture upload tool on the first page of ""new_classified"". When a user choses a file to upload the page is automatically *refreshed* and then the image is displayed on the same page under section ""images uploaded"". I hope the session wont interfere with this approach. Thanks Please use formatting wisely. it's hard to read such a pitted text I think it is worth your while to do logins and even on a very basic level it will help you to identify who is using your site etc. This is probably a big debate around developers what is the best way to do a good login system whether it's basic or not doesn't matter I think the concepts still stay the same. In your case I would suggest session cookies along with a login table consisting of user details. This would help you to verify the user on more than one occasion during his/her visit to the site. A login is checked against a user entry in a table and then a session cookie is created. This session you can choose to never expire also. You can then on every step check that the user is the user that is supposed to be logged in and get the companies details by checking the username. This would make for a better query in my opinion. Sessions aren't a lot of work and it's relatively easy to learn. http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.session.php http://www.9lessons.info/2010/02/php-login-script-with-encryption.html is a good example of what you can do with this.

128016,Java Swing: how do I set the maximum width of a JTextField? I'm writing a custom file selection component. In my UI first the user clicks a button which pops a JFileChooser; when it is closed the absolute path of the selected file is written to a JTextField. The problem is absolute paths are usually long which causes the text field to enlarge making its container too wide. I've tried this but it didn't do anything the text field is still too wide: fileNameTextField.setMaximumSize(new java.awt.Dimension(450 2147483647)); Currently when it is empty it is already 400px long because of GridBagConstraints attached to it. I'd like it to be like text fields in HTML pages which have a fixed size and do not enlarge when the input is too long. So how do I set the max size for a JTextField ? It may depend on the layout manager your text field is in. Some layout managers expand and some do not. Some expand only in some cases others always. I'm assuming you're doing filedNameTextField = new JTextField(80); // 80 == columns If so for most reasonable layouts the field should not change size (at least it shouldn't grow). Often layout managers behave badly when put into JScrollPanes. In my experience trying to control the sizes via setMaximumSize and setPreferredWidth and so on are precarious at best. Swing decided on its own with the layout manager and there's little you can do about it. All that being said I have no had the problem you are experiencing which leads me to believe that some judicious use of a layout manager will solve the problem.  I solved this by setting the maximum width on the container of the text field using setMaximumSize. According to davetron's answer this is a fragile solution because the layout manager might disregard that property. In my case the container is the top-most and in a first test it worked. Yeah that is unfortunately how it goes with Swing. It's a nice toolkit in many ways but the unpredictability of the components in different layout managers is really annoying.  Don't set any of the sizes on the text field. Instead set the column size to a non-zero value via setColumns or using the constructor with the column argument. What is happening is that the preferred size reported by the JTextComponent when columns is zero is the entire amount of space needed to render the text. When columns is set to a non-zero value the preferred size is the needed size to show that many standard column widths. (for a variable pitch font it is usually close to the size of the lower case 'm'). With columns set to zero the text field is requesting as much space as it can get and stretching out the whole container. Since you already have it in a GridBagLayout with a fill you could probably just set the columns to 1 and let the fill stretch it out based on the other components or some other suitably low number. I recommend this approach when using `FlowLayout`.,java swing,0.013728953010019473,0.7509083701590998,0.23495022998763285,4.1244684324789443E-4
3294432,"SQL query to get data from a large list of strings I have a large list of strings (1500 email addresses to be more specific) and I need to look up a piece of data in a very large DB table for each of the strings (e.g. the primary key mydataitem). How can I do it efficiently? For example this is way too slow (amongst other problems): $stringArray = ('foo''bar''baz'... 'for 1000s of items'); foreach($stringArray as $mystring) { $res = mysql_query(""select mydataitemblah FROM users WHERE blah = '$mystring'""); $info=mysql_fetch_assoc($res); ... } Things I want to avoid: I don't want to loop over the list and do a SELECT for each item. i.e. 1500 queries (as in example above) I don't want to read the whole table into an array in one query and do the lookup in code because it would take too much memory. The DB table has 100k+ rows. I don't want to build a massive query with 1499 ORs because the query would be too big. (for example ""select mydataitem FROM users WHERE blah = 'aaa' OR blah = 'bbb' OR ..."") Note: I'm using MySql v5.0.45 Update: Thanks everyone - for some reason I thought IN was just for Integer ID lists - now I know better. mysql_query(""select mydataitemblah FROM users WHERE blah IN ('"" .implode(""''""array_map('mysql_real_escape_string'$stringArray).""')'; Better yet use mysqli or PDO which can use prepared statements: $stmt = $PDO->prepare('select mydataitemblah FROM users WHERE blah IN (' .implode(''array_fill(0count($stringArray)'?')).')'; $stmt->execute($stringArray); Your query doesn't link mydataitem to a particular email address. Pfff. SELECT mydataitemblah then as `blah` apparantly IS the email address.  Unless this needs to but lightning fast I would just use a MySQL in clause turn the array into a string: $emails = array(""abc@def.com"" ""123@456.net"" ""me@google.com""); $list = ""(\"""". implode(""\"" \"""" $balls) . ""\"")""; then just use it in your sql $sql = ""select mydataitem FROM users WHERE blah in {$list}""; Your query doesn't link mydataitem to a particular email address.  If you use a prepared statement you can prepare it outside of your loop and then use it within your loop. That should run more quickly than a new mysql_query call each time. I don't know what you mean by a query being ""too big"". Try it and see how slow it is. Add a key on the email field if you don't already have one. This doesn't sound like the kind of code that would be running often so I would guess it's okay if it takes a second. If not maybe you can explain the goal of this code and we can help you figure out a better way of accomplishing that goal.  I think what you want is SELECT mydataitem FROM users WHERE blah IN ('foo' 'bar' 'baz' ...) Your query doesn't link mydataitem to a particular email address.  WHERE blah IN ('aaa''bbb'...) But it's still not efficient. If you explain why you need to retrieve so many records we might perhaps be able to come up with a more efficient logic.

I am not able to figure out if it's actually loading the bmp or not - a bit confused). At the moment I am converting bmps to raw then it's all easy. Anyone has any better and cleaner snippet? LoadImage() can only load bitmaps that are embedded into your executable file with the resource compiler - it can't load external bitmaps from the filesystem. Fortunately bitmap files are really simple to read yourself. See Wikipedia for a description of the file format. Just open up the file like you would with any other file (important: open it in binary mode i.e. with the ""rb"" option using fopen or the ios::binary flag using the C++ ifstream) read in the bitmap dimensions and read in the raw pixel data. Thanks for your remarks on LoadImage - I know how to open the file with ifstream - I was kinda hoping I could find some snippet instead of going there and figure out from scratch how to read byte-by-byte (I even think I already did it smt like N years ago) since it sounds like a common task  It is a common task that's why glaux among others gives you functions for it. Reading a bitmap is a trivial matter especially if there is only one depth/bpp to account for. Also see this question. I am not using glaux.

721802,"What disadvantages could I have using OpenGL for GUI design in a desktop application? There are tons of GUI libraries for C/C++ but very few of them are based on the idea that opengl is a rather multiplatform graphics library. Is there any big disadvantage on using this OpenGL for building my own minimal GUI in a portable application? Blender is doing that and it seems that it works well for it. EDIT: The point of my question is not about using an external library or making my own. My main concern is about the use of libraries that use opengl as backend. Agar CEGUI or Blender's GUI for instance. Thanks. Here's an oddball one that bit a large physics experiment I worked on: because an OpenGL GUI bypasses some of the usual graphics abstraction layers it may defeat remote viewing applications. In the particular instance I'm thinking of we wanted to allow remote shift operations over VNC. Everything worked fine except for the one program (which we only needed about once per hour but we really needed) that used an OpenGL interface. We had to delay until a remote version of the OpenGL interface could be prepared. I was not involved in the solution but they arranged to display the OpenGL on the remote host. A little clunky but it meant I could sit shift in my PJs in my usual time-zone so I was happy. Yes this is the kind of answer I was looking for. Thanks dmckee! Good point. Generally anything that uses 3D acceleration will be invisible to apps like VNC. There are some ways to make it work but it causes a lot of performance issues and so isn't a great idea. I think to fix this you have to think an app as GUI-core-decoupled so you don't need VNC to control it. Actually there are several possibilities to use OpenGL enabled applications remotely such as for example xvnc/xf4vnc virtualgl or even just plain X11. The best solution depends on whether you want the OpenGL hardware acceleration to be done on the remote machine or locally on the viewer.  You're losing the native platforms capabilities for accessibility. For example on Windows most controls provide information to screen readers or other tools supporting accessibility impaired users. Basically unless you have a real reason to do this you shouldn't.  Re-inventing the Wheel: Yeah you'd be doing it. But I note OP used the word ""minimal"" in the problem statement so assuming it really doesn't need to scale up to all that it may be a small enough wheel as to not matter. The product I currently work on supports OpenGL on three platforms (Win Mac Linux) and we built all our own widgets (text boxes buttons dialogs). It's a lot of work but now that we've done it we own a huge chunk of our stack and don't have to debug into third party frameworks when things don't work as expected. It's nice having complete control of the experience. There's always something you want to do that a framework doesn't support. Like everything in our business it is a trade-off and you just have to weigh your needs against your need to finish on time. Portability: Yes you will still have to write platform specific code to boot-strap everything. This will be difficult if you've not done it before as it requires you to understand all the target platforms. Windows Drivers: We've found that graphics card manufacturers have much better support for DirectX on Windows than OpenGL since that's what is required to get MSFT certification. Often low- to mid-range cards have bugs missing functionality or outright crashes in their OpenGL support.  With Qt 4.5 you can select if you want to use OpenGL as window renderer.

Here's the new link: http://blog.qt.digia.com/blog/2008/10/22/so-long-and-thanks-for-the-blit/ link updated :)  The obvious one is that you're basically building the GUI elements yourself instead of having a nice designed like for wxWidgets or Qt.  You cant just use opengl you need a platform specific code to set up a window for opengl. From the freely available opengl red book: OpenGL is designed as a streamlined hardware-independent interface to be implemented on many different hardware platforms. To achieve these qualities no commands for performing windowing tasks or obtaining user input are included in OpenGL; instead you must work through whatever windowing system controls the particular hardware you're using. There are multiplatform solutions for this like glut qt wxWidgets ... And if you have to use them anyway why not use built in GUI elements. They also give you the opportunity to build your own and make use of the framework to handle mouse/keyboard events and stuff. It's very easy to make a multiplatform opengl program using preprococessor conditions and glut. It's far from using a huge library like qt for the whole GUI system. It very similar to make a multiplatform opengl program using qt: derive from QGLWidget; override initialiseGL paintGL resizeGL; assign your new class as mainwidget to a QApplication and thats it. The library is bigger yes. But i dont see the problem with that? Can you please tell me how they give you the opportunity to build your own GUI elements?

MySQL only actually updates a row if there would be a noticeable difference before and after the updat.

Only when the mouse over operation is performed on particular component does it get displayed on the screen. Kindly can anyone help me out in solving this issue? Thanks in advance. sakkiharry Since Swing paints all UI itself it is not really influenced by Mac OS. There are exceptions though. If you allow Java to use a native menu the menu will behave like any other Swing menu but it is in fact translated to native menu functions (so it will be displayed on top of screen and behave like a native Mac OS X menu... nothing you as programmer need to care about but great for Mac users who hate menus to appear elsewhere). I guess your issue is probably something else but it's hard to guess if I have no code to work with. Can you break down the issue into an ultra minimal test case? E.g. can you just draw a JFrame add a singe one of your custom buttons there that shows the problematic behavior and just use as much code as is necessary to paint this minimal UI and expose the problem? If you'd post this code here I'd take a closer look into it and will try to find out what causes the issue and how to resolve it (I'm a graduated Java programmer but I also have years of Mac OS X development experience; so these are two fields of knowledge I should know really well but I usually don't combine them as I don't develop in Java for Mac OS X).,java osx swing netbeans,0.011754229353257527,0.9867880851003479,7.679929829331395E-4,6.896925634614682E-4

Thanks any particular aversion to QtCreator? This might be handy http://doc.trolltech.com/4.5/qtopengl.html If you are using Qt Designer (which I think is available via Eclipse Integration) you can place a base QWidget in the layout and then ""promote"" that widget to a QGLWidget. To do this: Add the QWidget to the desired place in the layout Right-click on the widget Select ""Promote To"" Enter QGLWidget as the class name and as the header Hit Add Select the QGLWidget from the list of promoted widgets at the top of the dialog Hit Promote This way you don't have to go through the placeholder route and create an additional layer. Thanks. That was just what I was after :-)  I had the same problem while using Qt Designer. I used a simple frame as a placeholder for the OpenGL widget then in main window constructor I created OpenGL widget manually and assigned it to the placeholder frame (as a child).

Ad Hoc Queries These are queries that you write to run one time or on rare occasions. How large of a result data set must you return that it would take longer to do a SELECT * than type out the column names? How likely are you to forget a column add it and have to run it again? Your time is more expensive than CPU time. If you're running it once let the database do the work. SELECT * is fine for ad hoc queries if it will save you time. There are exceptions such as Blob fields on large data sets but you get the point. Production Queries These are queries that are stored in your application or database. These queries are run often. How many times do you have to run a query to make up for the time it would take to name your columns? It adds up fast. Name your columns in production queries to allow your application to scale better and perform at maximum efficiency. There are other minor advantages but they're not as exciting. Summary Add Hoc Queries : SELECT * generally okay. Production Queries: SELECT * always bad. It's okay to be a little lazy but be smart about it.  Strongly disagree with marr75. First becasue if you do this poor techinie in most of your queries you are adding unnecessary load to virtually every query. Database queries need to be written as well optimized s possible as it is is exceedingly painful to later go bnack and rewrite every query in your datbase becasue you used a known poor techinique. Refactoring in datbases is hard and performance must be considered in design it is not premature optimaization to use techiniqes that are known to improve performance from the start it is good design. Next you have the maintenance issue. If you are depending onthese columns being in a particular order and someone changes the structure of the databe you are out of liuck. Alos if someone adds a column that you don't want to show the user (Which is is common) you are out of luck. THis is a very bad techinique and select * should almost never be used ina production system. If someone adds a column it will be returned inthe query but you need to know what was added and why in order to make the interface do what it needs to do anyway so you have no maintenance savings by using this poor technique. +1 waste a fraction of a second oh well. waste a fraction of a second a million times every day oh *%$@! don't be lazy only return the columns you need!  You are surely returning unnecessary results to answer your question. It is a bad habit to get into. So how should it be written then? SELECT table_name.column_name? What if there are alot of columns it would be a loooong query then right? @Camran you pick: one long SELECT statement or an even longer result set multiplied by the number of rows. You can use abbreviated table names for aliases which would shorten the query a bit. Naturally the query will be longer by naming the columns but as programmers we shan't be lazy. And I don't know about mySQl but in SQL Server I can drag and drop the columns into my query so listing them doesn't take much time at all.  This is a matter of opinion. Are you having performance or scaling issues? If not then being specific about which columns to return is probably a matter of premature optimization. Duplication of integer join columns isn't going to break the bandwidth bank any time soon. Okay... No I don't have performance issues. The website is not uploaded yet... Thanks for the answer -1 Not remotely a matter of opinion or taste. By only selecting the columns you need you maximise the chance that a query can be satisfied from an index alone and reduce the overall query processing workload. I hope the site's a success Camran. Once you you start having problems serving up requests then you should look at typing out every column name. A web framework (Cake Django Rails etc) could make this easier too. Django for example let's you pick just the columns you need with ""defer"" and ""only"" methods then generates the sql for you. I think we'll have to agree to disagree on that Martin optimized performance becomes a problem to look at once your app hits a bottleneck and is actively being used. Also the first optimization of performance I would do if I found this query to be a bottleneck would be to cache the results or the resulting pages outperforming any index or column optimization pretty easily. So fire fighting when performance suddenly becomes a problem is better than a fairly easy way of doing it right in the first place? Depending on the requirements and constraints. My take on this particular problem was that a solo developer is about to deploy a web app in a domain that already has a lot of alternatives it's important to understand that he could have written this query to perform better but there's a big chance it won't get used much anyway and there's an even bigger chance that this query will not be any kind of performance bottleneck that can't be better solved by caching. If he has a choice between launching today and launching tomorrow based on optimizing these queries I'm an advocate for today. when you get good at developing and go the the next level with your SQL you will discover the covering index where you include data (additional columns) in the index that is not part of the index. The database can then use these columns and return the results without going back to the table from the index find. If you always select * you can not use a covering index because you are asking for all the columns. When you are tuning your slow queries (which are fast now because the app is not live and has no data) you will not be able to use this technique. I don't think it's fair to make any assumptions about whether I'm ""good"" at developing or not based on my answer. My answer says yes this query can be optimized but I feel he should profile first with a real load before optimizing anything. Profiling with a real load will be made more difficult as he is not returning the columns he needs. The Database Tuning Advisor and missing index DMVs won't have anything to work with. @marr75 - I understand your point but this is generally considered SQL 101 not advanced optimization. this question about `select tableA.* tableB.* ...` is right up there with questions about `why can't I just make all my columns varchar(5000)` some people will call it an opinion on how to do it other will call it ridiculous. Try to get either of those past a code review.

746034,glDrawPixels in grayscale? I have an image that I'm rendering like this: glDrawPixels(image->width image->height GL_BGR GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE image->imageData); Is there anyway I can draw it in grayscale instead (without loading it into a texture first)? I don't care if only say the blue component is used for the gray value rather than the L2 norm or something I just need a quick and dirty output. GL_LUMINANCE would be great except that it won't work on a 3-channel image. @timday: A perverse idea for you to try and I've no idea if it'll work: glPixelZoom(1.0f/3.0f1.0f); glDrawPixels(3*widthheightGL_LUMINANCEGL_UNSIGNED_BYTEdata); ie treat your 3-channel image as being a 1-channel (grayscale) image 3 times as wide and compensate for this by squishing the width using the x zoom factor. I believe GL always does nearest-neighbour sampling for zoomed glDrawPixels so it ought to consistently pick out the same component from each triple of samples as you require. Oh my God..... I can't believe that works! It sort of splits the image in half and one side grainier than the other but it works. Could be something to do with the precision with which 1.0/3.0 is maintained internally (especially if it works OK up to a certain size). I'd suggest adjusting the ratio very slightly or using a 4-bytes-per-pixel format and a zoom factor of 0.25.,c++ opengl,0.8419571433893818,0.0010380300541336135,8.872782153849571E-4,0.15611754834109967
282539,"Java actionListener for a nameless JButton? I was wondering if there is a way to implement an action listener for a Jbutton without a name. For example I have the following for loop that creates a button for each letter of the alphabet. for (int i = 65; i < 91; i++){ alphabetPanel.add(new JButton(""<html><center>"" + (char)i)); } Is there a way that I can add an action listener for each of those buttons without getting rid of my for loop and hard coding each JButton and then creating an action listener for each? Thanks in advance Tomek Your question is a little vague. it would be trivial to modify the loop to add a listener inside the loop: ActionListener listener = something; for (int i = 65; i < 91; i++){ JButton button = new JButton(""<html><center>"" + (char)i); button.addActionListener( listener ); alphabetPanel.add(button); } if you can't modify the loop you could iterate over all of the panel's children and add listeners to any of the children that are jbuttons. also why are you using html to center the text? isn't that overkill? doesn't jbutton already center text? you could use setHorizontalAlignement(SwingConstants.CENTER) to do it too. for some reason I thought that te way action listener works is that after it is created it somehow stops there in the code until an action is performed but I guess that defeats the entire purpose of it. I changed it and it worked exactly as I wanted it to. Thanks! P.S. html was overkill  It is possible to add ActionListener to anonymous components like below: new JButton().addActionListener(new ActionListener(){ @Override public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent arg0) { // TODO your action } }); However in your case where you try to add the anonymous JButton to your panel this approach will not work because the return type of addActionListener method (which is void) will be taken instead of JButton's constructor as shown below: for (int i = 65; i < 91; i++){ alphabetPanel.add(new JButton(""<html><center>"" + (char)i).addActionListener(new ActionListener(){ @Override public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent arg0) { // TODO your action } })); } The above code complains about invalid argument for panel.add() method. So in your case you will have to create a named instance of the JButton. Hope this clarifies. Best Regards Suresh  What is the problem of doing this? for (int i = 65; i < 91; i++){ JButton button = new JButton(""<html><center>"" + (char)i)); button.addActionListener( new ButtonListener()); alphabetPanel.add(button); } ... class ButtonListener implements ActionListener { ButtonListener() { } public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) { //TODO: } } Also if the button's text doesn't identify the button you could set the button's name with the letter of the alphabet. button.setName((char)i)); // or button.setName(i);  By named you seem to mean storing the button instance in a local variable of your immediate method. Attempting to avoid that is likely to make your code more difficult to read. But to answer your question: The most obvious way is to use the old but newly-popular double-brace idiom. alphabetPanel.add(new JButton(""<html><center>"" + (char)i) {{ addActionListener(new ActionListener() { public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent event) { ... } }); }}); Note in this case as i is not final it will not be usable from the anonymous inner class. Either assign it to another (final) variable or reformulate the loop. Another route would be to go via an Action. (Usually I'd suggest avoiding Actions as they are jsut a poor man's Hashtable. ButtonModel is ""good"" though.) alphabetPanel.add(new JButton(new AbstractAction(""<html><center>"" + (char)i) { public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent event) { ... } })); Then of course there is the application specific library way: Form alphabetForm = new Form(alphabetPanel); for (char c='A'; c <= 'Z'; ++c) { alphabetForm.button(""<html><center>"" + c new ActionListener() { public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent event) { ... } }); }",java swing jbutton actionlistener,2.4434363846760897E-4,0.9991091662728556,3.406083382438639E-4,3.0588175043288476E-4
166356,"What are some best practices for OpenGL coding (esp. w.r.t. object orientation)? This semester I took a course in computer graphics at my University. At the moment we're starting to get into some of the more advanced stuff like heightmaps averaging normals tesselation etc. I come from an object-oriented background so I'm trying to put everything we do into reusable classes. I've had good success creating a camera class since it depends mostly on the one call to gluLookAt() which is pretty much independent of the rest of the OpenGL state machine. However I'm having some trouble with other aspects. Using objects to represent primitives hasn't really been a success for me. This is because the actual render calls depend on so many external things like the currently bound texture etc. If you suddenly want to change from a surface normal to a vertex normal for a particular class it causes a severe headache. I'm starting to wonder whether OO principles are applicable in OpenGL coding. At the very least I think that I should make my classes less granular. What is the stack overflow community's views on this? What are your best practices for OpenGL coding? if you do want to roll your own the above answers work well enough. A lot of the principles that are mentioned are implemented in most of the open source graphics engines. Scenegraphs are one method to move away from the direct mode opengl drawing. OpenScenegraph is one Open Source app that gives you a large (maybe too large) library of tools for doing OO 3D graphics there are a lot of other out there. This is the approach that Interactive Computer Graphics by Edward Angel takes towards OOP graphics programming. After reading Chapter 10 I'm convinced this is the correct answer. Thanks for the reference I'll definitely check it out later. Unfortunately our lecturers are a little draconian and we can't use 3rd party tools... :( Scenegraphs have their downsides this is highly recommended reading http://home.comcast.net/~tom_forsyth/blog.wiki.html#%5B%5BScene%20Graphs%20-%20just%20say%20no%5D%5D  I usually have a drawOpenGl() function per class that can be rendered that contains it's opengl calls. That function gets called from the renderloop. The class holds all info needed for its opengl function calls eg. about position and orientation so it can do its own transformation. When objects are dependent on eachother eg. they make a part of a bigger object then compose those classes in a other class that represents that object. Which has its own drawOpenGL() function that calls all the drawOpenGL() functions of its children so you can have surrounding position/orientation calls using push- and popmatrix. It has been some time but i guess something similar is possible with textures. If you want to switch between surface normals or vertex normals then let the object remember if its one or the other and have 2 private functions for each occasion that drawOpenGL() calls when needed. There are certainly other more elegant solutions (eg. using the strategy design pattern or something) but this one could work as far as I understand your problem sry for the late answer. yes im thinking: a mesh class consisting of a list of triangle classes and maybe the function for the avarage normals; the triangle class can generate its own normal. The mesh could do the drawing of the triangles. A primitive can be a mesh with a specific form. This is the approach I'm using now (w.r.t. the 2 private functions). It doesn't quite work out for me since each Triangle class depends on 6 other Triangles for normal averaging. Would you also recommend modelling a mesh instead of primitives as my basic class?  The most practical approach seems to be to ignore most of OpenGL functionality that is not directly applicable (or is slow or not hardware accelerated or is a no longer a good match for the hardware). OOP or not to render some scene those are various types and entities that you usually have: Geometry (meshes). Most often this is an array of vertices and array of indices (i.e. three indices per triangle aka ""triangle list""). A vertex can be in some arbitrary format (e.g. only a float3 position; a float3 position + float3 normal; a float3 position + float3 normal + float2 texcoord; and so on and so on). So to define a piece of geometry you need: define it's vertex format (could be a bitmask an enum from a list of formats; ...) have array of vertices with their components interleaved (""interleaved arrays"") have array of triangles. If you're in OOP land you could call this class a Mesh. Materials - things that define how some piece of geometry is rendered. In a simplest case this could be a color of the object for example. Or whether lighting should be applied. Or whether the object should be alpha-blended. Or a texture (or a list of textures) to use. Or a vertex/fragment shader to use. And so on the possibilities are endless. Start by putting things that you need into materials. In OOP land that class could be called (surprise!) a Material. Scene - you have pieces of geometry a collection of materials time to define what is in the scene. In a simple case each object in the scene could be defined by: - What geometry it uses (pointer to Mesh) - How it should be rendered (pointer to Material) - Where it is located. This could be a 4x4 transformation matrix or a 4x3 transformation matrix or a vector (position) quaternion (orientation) and another vector (scale). Let's call this a Node in OOP land. Camera. Well a camera is nothing more than ""where it is placed"" (again a 4x4 or 4x3 matrix or a position and orientation) plus some projection parameters (field of view aspect ratio ...). So basically that's it! You have a scene which is a bunch of Nodes which reference Meshes and Materials and you have a Camera that defines where a viewer is. Now where to put actual OpenGL calls is a design question only. I'd say don't put OpenGL calls into Node or Mesh or Material classes. Instead make something like OpenGLRenderer that can traverse the scene and issue all calls. Or even better make something that traverses the scene independent of OpenGL and put lower level calls into OpenGL dependent class. So yes all of the above is pretty much platform independent. Going this way you'll find that glRotate glTranslate gluLookAt and friends are quite useless. You have all the matrices already just pass them to OpenGL. This is how most of real actual code in real games/applications work anyway. Of course the above can be complicated by more complex requirements. Particularly Materials can be quite complex. Meshes usually need to support lots of different vertex formats (e.g. packed normals for efficiency). Scene Nodes might need to be organized in a hierarchy (this one can be easy - just add parent/children pointers to the node). Skinned meshes and animations in general add complexity. And so on. But the main idea is simple: there is Geometry there are Materials there are objects in the scene. Then some small piece of code is able to render them. In OpenGL case setting up meshes would most likely create/activate/modify VBO objects. Before any node is rendered matrices would need to be set. And setting up Material would touch most of remaining OpenGL state (blending texturing lighting combiners shaders ...). Your idea for the mesh class seems obvious to me now :) What I was trying to do was to use objects for primitives like triangles. Using objects to manage meshes makes a lot more sense as they tend to be pretty self sufficient correct? Also thanks a lot for the insight into the platform independence stuff and the render trees! That helps a lot! I think this is a great answer! ... Anyone starting to write a 3d engine should base it on these principles. (Or even better: use a engine that does all this for you and save valueable time)  Object transformations Avoid depending on OpenGL to do your transformations. Often tutorials teach you how to play with the transformation matrix stack. I would not recommend using this approach since you may need some matrix later that will only be accessible through this stack and using it is very long since the GPU bus is designed to be fast from CPU to GPU but not the other way. Master object A 3D scene is often thought as a tree of objects in order to know object dependencies. There is a debate about what should be at the root of this tree a list of object or a master object. I advice using a master object. While it does not have a graphical representation it will be simpler because you will be able to use recursion more effectively. Decouple scene manager and renderer I disagree with @ejac that you should have a method on each object doing OpenGL calls. Having a separate Renderer class browsing your scene and doing all the OpenGL calls will help you decouple your scene logic and OpenGL code. This is adds some design difficulty but will give you more flexibility if you ever have to change from OpenGL to DirectX or anything else API related. From what I've seen I definitely agree with your last point. I will have to try out the second pattern but my work isn't really complicated enough to warrant platform independence (it's just a couple of throw-away practical excercises).  A standard technique is to insulate the objects' effect on the render state from each other by doing all changes from some default OpenGL state within a glPushAttrib/glPopAttrib scope. In C++ define a class with constructor containing  glPushAttrib(GL_ALL_ATTRIB_BITS); glPushClientAttrib(GL_CLIENT_ALL_ATTRIB_BITS); and destructor containing  glPopClientAttrib(); glPopAttrib(); and use the class RAII-style to wrap any code which messes with the OpenGL state. Provided you follow the pattern each object's render method gets a ""clean slate"" and doesn't need to worry about prodding every possibly modified bit of openGL state to be what it needs. As an optimisation typically you'd set the OpenGL state once at app startup into some state which is as close as possible to what everything wants; this minimisies the number of calls which need to be made within the pushed scopes. The bad news is these aren't cheap calls. I've never really investigated how many per second you can get away with; certainly enough to be useful in complex scenes. The main thing is to try and make the most of states once you've set them. If you've got an army of orcs to render with different shaders textures etc for armour and skin don't iterate over all the orcs rendering armour/skin/armour/skin/...; make sure you set up the state for the armour once and render all the orcs' armour then setup to render all the skin. It's kinda strange to instantiate an object call its render() function and then destroy it just to insulate the state. Am I understanding correctly? Sorry I didn't explain it very well. The object doing push/pop on the GL state is just a convenience helper... nothing to do with the objects you're rendering. Code would look something like: renderable* thing=new...; { gl_pushed_scope p; thing->render(); }",c++ opengl oop,0.7718786337462488,0.2278861922234613,1.2390326945163095E-4,1.112707608381781E-4

791687,OpenGL: glTexImage2D conflicts with glGenLists & glCallList? I have a simple OpenGL application where I have 2 objects displayed on screen: 1) particle system where each particle is texture mapped with glTexImage2D() call. In the drawEvent function I draw it as a GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP with 4 glVertex3f. 2) a 3D text loaded from an object file where each point is loaded using glNewList/glGenLists and store each point as glVertex. I draw it by making call to glCallList. The problem is as soon as I call glTexImage2D() to map my particle with a .bmp file the 3D text would not show on the screen. The particle would look fine. (this is not expected) If I dont call glTexImage2D I see both the 3D text and particle system. In this case particle system looks horrible because I didnt texture map with anything. (this is expected) Does anyone know why using call list and glTexImage2D might conflict with each other? EDIT i also forgot to mention: I do call glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D this->texture); inside the drawLoop before particle system is called. EDIT2 i only call glTexImage2D() once at system start up (when I texture mapped the bitmap) glTexImage2D uploads the texture to the video-ram (simplified said). If OpenGL would allow you to place a glTexImage2D call inside the list it had to store the pixel-data in the list as well. Now what happends if you would execute the list? You would upload the same image data into the same texture all over gain. That makes no sense therefore it's left out. If you want to change textures between draw calls use glBindTexure. That call sets the current texture. It's much faster. Regarding your image-upload via glTexImage2D: Do that only once for each texture. Either at the start of your program (if it's small) or each time you load new content from disk. hi nils..yes i only call glTextImage2D once (at the start of the program) if you do so why do you want to put it into a list? hi..i'm sorry i dont explain clearly. i put all of my 3D fonts into a list. for particle system i use glGenTextures(1 &this->texture); glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D this->texture); glTexParameterf(GL_TEXTURE_2DGL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S GL_REPEAT); glTexParameterf(GL_TEXTURE_2DGL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T GL_REPEAT); glTexParameterf(GL_TEXTURE_2DGL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER GL_LINEAR); glTexParameterf(GL_TEXTURE_2DGL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER GL_LINEAR);  I already solve this problem. Before use GL_TEXTURE_2D you need set enable function=> glEnable(GL_TEXTURE_2D); And before use glCallList you also need set disable function => glDisable(GL_TEXTURE_2D);  It might not be a conflict of glTexImage2D and glCallList at all. Is your texture mapping ok ? have you set the texture coordinates propperly? Try checking for a vertex to texture coordinates missmatch. texture mapping looks ok for my particle system. the two when instantiated independently work fine. it's only when i to have them both displayed on the same screen it doesnt work.,c++ c opengl,0.9987038666476222,4.942556557609893E-4,4.2247550968411925E-4,3.794021869326084E-4

I mean for a query to FIND stuff you do  $res=mysql_query($var); $nr=mysql_num_rows($res); and you get nr of rows returned. Is there any similiar method for deletion of records? Thanks Use mysql_affected_rows(). It does not require the response as a parameter. mysql_query('DELETE FROM whatever'); $num = mysql_affected_rows(); Also I like PDO better than the classic mysql_ functions.

1071060,"Single Autonumber Instead of Multiple Key Is there a reason to use a single incrementing field for a primary key instead of multiple fields that actually represent the unique record? I'm working on an existing php application and the tables all seem to have a single 'id' key instead of using the 2 or more fields that are actually unique to the record (like user auction bid). I'm not a database expert but that just seems lazy (or inexperienced) to me. Is there any benefit (performance or otherwise)? Updated: I'm not referring to psudo-unique data (ssn e-mail address etc) where you may want to ensure the data is really unique. I'm talking about tables with obvious foreign key references but instead of using those references along with the unique field(s) in the table itself every table just has an incrementing ID. Not trying to start up a subjective debate it just didn't make sense to me. Here are a few points to use autonumber Autonumbers are a single unique key that make foreign key relationships much easier to maintain and use Autonumbers are numbers so it is pretty easy to use them and not mess them up. What I mean is if your primary key is a string and your developer forgets to put that in single quotes it will destroy your performance It is normal standard practice to use an autonumber You can still make other fields ""unique"" resetting a sequence is much easier with an autonumber if you need to jump ahead in the sequence it is much easier with a number than a combo of attributes or strings Just a few things...  Almost every ""natural"" key combination I've ever tried to use in a database ended up being non-unique over time. Data models need to evolve quickly as abstractions become leaky. That includes names phone numbers SSNs legal document references page numbers email addresses usernames project numbers and a few other things I've tried to use over my career. Aside from that the other answers regarding performance for writing new records comparing foreign keys etc. are enough reason alone. You can preserve your current business logic of uniqueness without baking it into the primary key--just set up a unique index on your natural-key columns. You'll pay a price on inserts and updates as with any index but if it happens to also be a useful index (helps to cover some queries) all the better. So if the 'natural' key is replaced by a surrogate key say a username becomes a userid (unique generated number) why not use the userid (along with other immutable ids) as the keys for related tables? A PK by definition is unique. For argumentative purposes you have just created a PK every time that a Unique Constraint is built. Why not just break off the table and replace it with a view?  Yes this will spur debate. In general primary key data should be immutable which is frequently not the case when using a natural key derived from the table data. As noted earlier things like SSNs can often be changed thus throwing off immutability. Monotonically increasing surrogate keys like ""autonumber"" or ""identity"" columns are a simple substitute for a natural key. However they can be prone to index inefficiencies since they may not balance well across B-tree style index algorithms. This can be remedied by using a randomly generated surrogate key like a uniqueidentifier i.e. GUID in MS SQL Server but I've read that this also has performance ramifications. Generally I use a surrogate key produced from a sequential feature like autonumber or identity for ease of table joins.  Well the id's give a sequential ordering to your database from 1-infinity. User names and such are transient and aren't always ordered. So presumably it would make searching faster. Plus it seems like you're suggesting having multiple keys signify an item. That is generally going to slow things down because now two things have to be checked to make sure something is the right item instead of one.  It all comes down to how ""normal"" your data structure is. A highly normalized databaseby definition can only have single field for the primary key. In this case there is little to any reason to use a serial or auto generated number as a PK. The data structure should be designed with with unique entries as PK(tracking people is a problem there are only so many names). Of course with normalization comes the performance penalty so the database is de-normalized to make is usable(very common for web apps). With a heavily de-normalized DB many times it is impossible to get a PK without using every field in the table. Remember that the reason that the structure is de-normalized is to increase the performance. All of the databases that I am familiar with builds an index for every PK. The larger the index the larger the overhead to maintain the index. Building gigantic indexes will kill the insert and update time performance making the de-normalization useless(unless its a read-only DB). It also takes longer to search gigantic indices and uses more memory than smaller ones as well. In summery It is often advantageous for performance reasons to to auto-generate the PK for any table that requires multiple fields to get a unique PK.  Using synthetic primary keys has several advantages: You can change values in key fields without having to take an index update hit The indexes are smaller It makes foreign key relationships simpler Since you're not dealing with strings there are never encoding issues Databases often have specific optimizations around building indexes with monotonically incrementing keys. That being said there is nothing wrong with a little denormalization now and then. If the use-case is clear and the tables are relatively small do what's convenient. -1 ""there is nothing wrong with a little denormalization now and then""  Oh dear it looks like we're opening up the great natural vs. surrogate keys debate again. The simplest reason is to prevent data redundancy. Natural keys tend to require multiple keys that may change over the lifetime of the database. For example if a person gets married and changes their last name then that last name has to be updated everywhere it's referenced. This isn't a problem if you have your foreign keys set to on update cascade as the DB will do it for you. As your table nest further and further you may find your keys need more and more columns. I've actually seen a table that had a seven-column primary key. For a table that only had four other columns. On redundancy now the code is responsibly to check for duplicate data instead of the database stopping duplicate data. For example in the code that prompted this question before an auction offer can be submitted the code has to check the database for any offers of the same value from the same user for the same auction. Sure it should do that anyway but if the code fails the database won't stop it. In that case there's duplicate data. R. Bemrose wrote : This isn't a problem if you have your foreign keys set to on update cascade as the DB will do it for you. But all references to this record outsite your database are lost. If you have interfaces with other systems your in trouble. @Tim Lytle: There's nothing stopping you from having unique constraints.  You generally want a clustered index on your primary key. The issue with having a compound clustered primary key is that as you insert new rows SQL has to stick the new record in between other records which means shuffling. In addition the larger your primary key the more space is required to store it. Here is an article on using a GUID as a primary key but the same holds true for a compound key. Also see this great answer.  in most cases it's really not clear-cut when those fields really uniquely identify the entity represented by the record. again and again I've seen cases where old database concepts entrenched in the business mentality hamper any further evolution.  It depends on the definition of ""Unique"". Yes names email addresses and SSN values are supposed to be ""unique"". However stranger things have happened. Having a separate ID value in a lot of cases can make life a lot easier... Update Based on the edit to the question I don't really see much of a need. It sounds like the situation you have is something like. a ""join table"" something where you are simply creating an association of a UniqueId from one table to the UniqueId of another table. A simple example of what I'm thinking you are talking about would be a User -> Role association. You must associate a User to a Role. A UserId and a RoleId. You have in your database a structure similar to MappingId (Your Auto Number) (This is the PK) UserId (From the user table) RoleId (From the Role table) This structure does NOT make sense to me I would have just the User and RoleId make up the Primary Key since there is no need to duplicate entries here. If you have something different that might change things... Agreed. I typically opt for a sythetic primary key but then add an index with a uniqueness constraint to identify the natural key. That way I can change / delete the index if my initial assumptions during design no longer hold. SSNs will be reused over time. After all the number of people alive in the US is estimated to be 306808431 according to the US Census population clock... nearly 1/3 of the available space for SSNs. Updated the question to make it clearer not talking about questionably unique data. I mean a table with a userid auctionid etc but sill have a single auto incrementing primary key. Posted updated comments I wanted it to be more abstract guess that might have been less than helpful. Example: A 'bid' table has the auctionid the userid and the bid amount (along with other data about the bid). Why then do they use a bidid as the primary key? It's not just joining tables but it seems to me that you would want to use the other keys to *avoid* duplicate data. So a user can't bid the same amount more than once (sure the code should check that but shouldn't the database ensure that as well?",php sql database database-design,8.808891990596042E-5,0.016265191886472567,0.9512933744789068,0.03235334471471452

3006164,"Should I sanitize EVERY form variable passed along? I have a form with many fields... The action is set to a php page which queries mysql... Should I sanitize with mysql_real_escape_string every single variable? Or can I ignore sanitizing drop-lists and radios for instance? Also besides mysql_real_escape_string what else should I do to prevent attacks? Thanks Here is a derived table approach that can avoid SQL Injection http://beyondrelational.com/blogs/madhivanan/archive/2010/05/14/derived-table-new-approach-to-avoid-sql-injection.aspx incredible stupid approach So do you think the method is open to SQL Injection? Yes it is still open. I've not evaluated Method 1 but in Method 2 1=1 would pass and return unfiltered values from the SQL. If those were medical appointments joined to patient records and you were EXPECTING to pass in Patient_ID = nnnnn... but I called it with 1=1 that would be injection and Method 2 would fail - I'd get a complete list of every patient and their appointments. You set up a single case SQL Injection and built a function that stops that one case. Yes. That would anywany avoid updating the table Try with any DML or DDL statements  Another bunch of ignorant answers. Camran you're attracting it like magnet. You have to understand that mysql_real_escape_string has nothing to do with forms and radios with checking and sanitizing. And it does not prevent attacks. It is merely a string escaping function. It escapes a data that going to be inserted into SQL query string as a string data. SQL query is a little program. With it's own syntax. You must follow that syntax not because of ""attacks"" but because of it's just a syntax. And of course these rules do not depend on the source of data! Radio button html form or browser - all doesn't matter! And it works only with strings. Not with numbers nor identifiers. Here is my answer on how to handle an SQL query: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2993027/in-php-when-submitting-strings-to-the-db-should-i-take-care-of-illegal-characters/2995163#2995163  You only have to sanitize the fields that you don't want an attacker to hijack. The data can be form any source not just your page. mysql_real_escape_string is good for any value that will concatenated into a query but I ""sanitize"" everything. To me ""sanitize"" means more than handling injection attacks it includes any field validation as well (sting length numeric valid date empty etc).  In general it is trivial to form a POST request outside of the browser and so bypass any restrictions the drop down list (for example) may have imposed on possible values. Because of this you should always treat user data as hostile and error-prone and put as much validation and protection on the server-side as possible.  You only need to use mysql_real_escape_string to escape strings prior to using them in SQL statements to prevent SQL Injection attacks. In addition when taking data out of your database and writing it out as HTML you should consider using htmlspecialchars or strip_tags to prevent cross-site scripting attacks. Better to use htmlspecialchars() I think. strip_tags is not always working as intended. neither htmlspecialchars nor mysql_real_escape_string work as a magic pill under all conditions please see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/110575/do-htmlspecialchars-and-mysql-real-escape-string-keep-my-php-code-safe-from-injec  Any variable sent from the client can't be consider as safe and valid. If you are using them in query you should always sanitize them. what about variables that weren't sent from the client?  You must check selects and radio buttons too. Anyone can create their own HTML form and post it to your script. The Firefox extension Web Developer Toolbar even has an option to convert selects to text inputs. You can also check that the posted data only contains correct values. For example if you have a radio button make sure that the posted form only contain one of the valid values. You should of course only run mysql_real_escape_string on variables that you are going to put into MySQL. If saving to file using on the commandline or anything other there are more apropriate functions and solutions. remember mysql_real_escape_string is only safe to use when the escaped value is delimited by single quotes in the resultant sql statement.

309023,"How to bring a window to the front? We have a Java-application that needs to be brought to the foreground when a telecontrol mechanism activates something in the application. In order to get this we have realised in the called method of the Class which represents the Frame of our application (extension of a JFrame) following implementation: setVisible(true); toFront(); Under Windows XP this works the first time it is called on the second time only the tab in the taskbar flashes the frame doesn't come to the front anymore. Same goes for Win2k. On Vista it seems to work fine. Anyone ideas? do you have a sample for this behavior? The proper answer is to call `toFront()` on the EDT using `invokeLater`. There is a simple answer included below but it is not the accepted answer. It does work though. Perfectly. I know this is old but this also happens on OSX I'm experiencing this problem but none of the answers below seems to solve it. I'm sure it's caused by windows not allowing me to 'Steal' Focus for my first window in the application. Here's a method that REALLY works (tested on Windows Vista) :D  frame.setExtendedState(JFrame.ICONIFIED); frame.setExtendedState(fullscreen ? JFrame.MAXIMIZED_BOTH : JFrame.NORMAL); The fullscreen variable indicates if you want the app to run full screen or windowed. This does not flash the task bar but bring the window to front reliably. Thanks for the setExtendedState tip. I used it along with the toFront() and repaint() solution to bring the window to the foreground even if it was minimized. Confirmed: this solution works in WindowsXP using toFront results in flashing message in task bar. Thanks!  Simplest way I've found that doesn't have inconsistency across platforms: setVisible(false); setVisible(true); causes some blinking though doesn't it? nice and simple though :) did not work for my background process. Also window comes up white for the first refresh if called from foreground process. Can't use for screen grabs.  Windows has the facility to prevent windows from stealing focus; instead it flashes the taskbar icon. In XP it's on by default (the only place I've seen to change it is using TweakUI but there is a registry setting somewhere). In Vista they may have changed the default and/or exposed it as a user accessible setting with the out-of-the-box UI. Preventing windows from forcing themselves to the front and taking focus is a feature since Windows 2K (and I for one am thankful for it). That said I have a little Java app I use to remind me to record my activities while working and it makes itself the active window every 30 minutes (configurable of course). It always works consistently under Windows XP and never flashes the title bar window. It uses the following code called in the UI thread as a result of a timer event firing: if(getState()!=Frame.NORMAL) { setState(Frame.NORMAL); } toFront(); repaint(); (the first line restores if minimized... actually it would restore it if maximized too but I never have it so). While I usually have this app minimized quite often it's simply behind my text editor. And like I said it always works. I do have an idea on what your problem could be - perhaps you have a race condition with the setVisible() call. toFront() may not be valid unless the window is actually displayed when it is called; I have had this problem with requestFocus() before. You may need to put the toFront() call in a UI listener on a window activated event. 2014-09-07: At some point in time the above code stopped working perhaps at Java 6 or 7. After some investigation and experimentation I had to update the code to override the window's toFront method do this (in conjunction with modified code from what is above): setVisible(true); toFront(); requestFocus(); repaint(); ... public @Override void toFront() { int sta=super.getExtendedState()&~JFrame.ICONIFIED&JFrame.NORMAL; super.setExtendedState(sta); super.setAlwaysOnTop(true); super.toFront(); super.requestFocus(); super.setAlwaysOnTop(false); } As of Java 8_20 this code seems to be working fine. +1 for supporting not allowing windows to steal the focus. I hate when that happens when I'm typing in a document. I completely agree with you against stealing focus but in this precise case the user expects the application to come to the front. But it would uncool to change the registry settings and change the complete windows behavior.  This simple method worked for me perfectly in Windows 7:  private void BringToFront() { java.awt.EventQueue.invokeLater(new Runnable() { @Override public void run() { if(jFrame != null) { jFrame.toFront(); jFrame.repaint(); } } }); }  Hj all methods of yours are not working for me in Fedora KDE 14. I have a dirty way to do bring a window to front while we're waiting for Oracle to fix this issue. import java.awt.MouseInfo; import java.awt.Point; import java.awt.Robot; import java.awt.event.InputEvent; public class FrameMain extends javax.swing.JFrame { //... private final javax.swing.JFrame mainFrame = this; private void toggleVisible() { setVisible(!isVisible()); if (isVisible()) { toFront(); requestFocus(); setAlwaysOnTop(true); try { //remember the last location of mouse final Point oldMouseLocation = MouseInfo.getPointerInfo().getLocation(); //simulate a mouse click on title bar of window Robot robot = new Robot(); robot.mouseMove(mainFrame.getX() + 100 mainFrame.getY() + 5); robot.mousePress(InputEvent.BUTTON1_DOWN_MASK); robot.mouseRelease(InputEvent.BUTTON1_DOWN_MASK); //move mouse to old location robot.mouseMove((int) oldMouseLocation.getX() (int) oldMouseLocation.getY()); } catch (Exception ex) { //just ignore exception or you can handle it as you want } finally { setAlwaysOnTop(false); } } } //... } And this works perfectly in my Fedora KDE 14 :-) I love it. Thanks for this one. A little hacky works for us but only for the first call :-). (Kubuntu 12.04) - other solution did fail  The rules governing what happens when you .toFront() a JFrame are the same in windows and in linux : -> if a window of the existing application is currently the focused window then focus swaps to the requested window -> if not the window merely flashes in the taskbar BUT : -> new windows automatically get focus So let's exploit this ! You want to bring a window to the front how to do it ? Well : Create an empty non-purpose window Show it Wait for it to show up on screen (setVisible does that) When shown request focus for the window you actually want to bring the focus to hide the empty window destroy it Or in java code : // unminimize if necessary this.setExtendedState(this.getExtendedState() & ~JFrame.ICONIFIED); // don't blame me blame my upbringing // or better yet blame java ! final JFrame newFrame = new JFrame(); newFrame.add(new JLabel(""boembabies is this in front ?"")); newFrame.pack(); newFrame.setVisible(true); newFrame.toFront(); this.toFront(); this.requestFocus(); // I'm not 100% positive invokeLater is necessary but it seems to be on // WinXP. I'd be lying if I said I understand why SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable() { @Override public void run() { newFrame.setVisible(false); } }); Didn't work on Win7 both windows flash (if I don't hide the 2nd). Creative. Didn't work for my background process on Win7 when covered. New frame does not come up on top. Older JDK 6u21.  A possible solution is: java.awt.EventQueue.invokeLater(new Runnable() { @Override public void run() { myFrame.toFront(); myFrame.repaint(); } }); +1 WORKS! Simple to the point. Perhaps one should start ALL the UI code inside invokeLater in first place? ;) Did not work for me in Java 7 on KDE 4.9.5 the window would still hide below other programs. What helped me was changing the order of bringing windows to the front. Instead of hiding one window and show the second window show the second window and then hide the first window (JFrame).  I tested your answers and only Stefan Reich's one worked for me. Although I couldn't manage to restore the window to its previous state (maximized/normal). I found this mutation better: view.setState(java.awt.Frame.ICONIFIED); view.setState(java.awt.Frame.NORMAL); That is setState instead of setExtendedState.  There are numerous caveats in the javadoc for the toFront() method which may be causing your problem. But I'll take a guess anyway when ""only the tab in the taskbar flashes"" has the application been minimized? If so the following line from the javadoc may apply: ""If this Window is visible brings this Window to the front and may make it the focused Window.""  I had the same problem with brining a frame to the front under Ubuntu (Java 1.6.0_10). And the only way I could resolve it is by providing a window listener. Specifically I had to set frame to always stay on top whenever toFront is invoked and provide windowDeactivated event handler to setAlwaysOnTop(false). So here is the code that could be placed into a base frame which is used to derive all application frames. @Override public void setVisible(final boolean visible) { // make sure that frame is marked as not disposed if it is asked to be visible if (visible) { setDisposed(false); } // let's handle visibility... if (!visible || !isVisible()) { // have to check this condition simply because super.setVisible(true) invokes toFront if frame was already visible super.setVisible(visible); } // ...and bring frame to the front.. in a strange and weird way if (visible) { int state = super.getExtendedState(); state &= ~JFrame.ICONIFIED; super.setExtendedState(state); super.setAlwaysOnTop(true); super.toFront(); super.requestFocus(); super.setAlwaysOnTop(false); } } @Override public void toFront() { super.setVisible(true); int state = super.getExtendedState(); state &= ~JFrame.ICONIFIED; super.setExtendedState(state); super.setAlwaysOnTop(true); super.toFront(); super.requestFocus(); super.setAlwaysOnTop(false); } Whenever frame should be displayed or brought to front call frame.setVisible(true). Since I moved to Ubuntu 9.04 there seems to be no need in having a window listener for invoking super.setAlwaysOnTop(false) -- as can be observed this code was moved to methods toFront and setVisible. Pls note that method setVisible should always be invoked on EDT. Worked under all circumstances so I accepted this one. Thanks!

What does your code look like when you `echo` the results? I meant the actual while loop. :) could I have the FK setup wrongly here? The FK is in the fordon table maybe it should be other way around? (does it matter) Try to change the query from `SELECT * FROM ...` to `SELECT fordon.type classified.headline FROM ...` just to see if your query is set up correctly. Let me know if that returns the results but I cannot tell if it has anything to do with where the foreign key resides. it give a 'unknown column 'year' in field list'... but the headline works! hmmmm I have to get to work now but I will have to try some more later...

I believe that is what he wants to achieve. understood but what if you have classified.field_name and fordon.field_name. You now have an error because you are using SELECT *.

143341,Are there any frameworks for handling database requests in swing applications? I believe any programmer who has been dealing with database requests in a gui application has run into some or all of the following problems: Your GUI freezes because you call database layer from within the event dispatch thread When you have multiple windows/panels/jframes where user can start a db request your performance degrades because you don't have any control about the threads your user creates User may be able to lock down the application and even the database because he calls any action many times before the first action has been finished What I'd like to know about: are there any frameworks that handle the requirements of handling an ordered set of long running actions (including but not limited to database calls i.e. calculations) outside the event dispatch thread? Note: I know of SwingWorker ;-) Such a thing should be found in Netbeans for example. See RequestProcessor. But in simpler cases this is not required. Last time I need something like thread scheduling and control I simply used new concurrency packages included in J5 (I used J6). With its ExecutorFactory-ies you can simply achieve basic control over tasks. You can also use some queues. This PDF can help. The PDF is written in Slovak language but the Single/Multiple task workers are there written in Java ;)  Naked Objects facilitate a clean domain model and they also have a GUI 2 DB mapping layer -- http://www.nakedobjects.org/home/index.shtml  I doubt you will find something specific for database requests. You can try to reuse existing generic task scheduling libraries. An example is the Eclipse jobs API. This does not depend on the IDE. See http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-Concurrency/jobs-api.html That has been my impression at the time too. We've developed a kind of queue where you could add SwingWorker instances that would execute in scheduled order.,java database multithreading swing,4.158353522314448E-4,0.7194365564540175,0.2796270444245032,5.205637692478379E-4
1176014,"How to model a many to many relationship? With only a bit of previous experience with databases and no formal education with them I'm a bit stuck as to how to model this (and retrieve the data I require from it in PHP). This is what I'm trying to model: For each item on my site it is allowed to have multiple tags such as file upload php recursive etc. However the tags are reusable I can have two different items and they each could have the php tag. I've been trying to read up on how to do this and whether it is lack of experience with it or something else I don't know but I can't seem to grasp the concept. Apparently you need a middle table which links the two together? Also once I have this relationship and the tables defined how would I do things such as: - Retrieve all items with a certain tag? - Retrieve all tags that one item has? Thanks for your help also if anyone could list any further reading on this to strengthen my understanding of the concept that would be great. The db part is easy. This is just a sample so you can see how db can look like not any particular SQL engine queries. CREATE TABLE posts ( id INT PRIMARY KEY subject VARCHAR(100) body TEXT ) CREATE TABLE tags ( id INT PRIMARY KEY name VARCHAR(50) ) CREATE TABLE post_tags ( post_id INT tag_id INT FOREIGN KEY (post_id) REFERENCES posts (id) FOREIGN KEY (tag_id) REFERENCES posts (id) ) To get items with yourTag tag you will just run query like this SELECT P.* FROM posts P LEFT JOIN post_tags PT ON (PT.post_id = P.id) LEFT JOIN tags T ON (T.id = PT.tag_id) WHERE T.name = 'yourTag'; To get tags associated with post with id of 123 you run this query: SELECT T.* FROM tags T LEFT JOIN post_tags PT ON (T.id = PT.tag_id) LEFT JOIN posts P ON (PT.post_id = P.id) WHERE P.id = 123; For the PHP part you could use a framework. Many (if not all) frameworks can easily model such relationships. For example in CakePHP this done like that: class Post extends AppModel { $useTable = 'posts'; $hasAndBelongsToMany = array( 'Tag' => array( 'className' => 'Tag' 'joinTable' => 'post_tags' 'foreignKey' => 'post_id' 'associationForeignKey' => 'tag_id' ) ); } class Tag extends AppModel { $useTable = 'tags'; $hasAndBelongsToMany = array( 'Post' => array( 'className' => 'Post' 'joinTable' => 'post_tags' 'foreignKey' => 'tag_id' 'associationForeignKey' => 'post_id' ) ); } ITYM Tag->$hasAndBelongsToMany = array( 'Post' ... etc. Thanks for the database part thats fantastic. I use CodeIgniter and it doesn't actually model relationships like that you have to do it yourself. Plus I'd prefer to actually understand the SQL queries involved as opposed to relying on automagic. @Stobor - thanks for finding that this was a copying error @James - I put a sample query for you as well. Understanding queries is important but once you start working with ORM you won't probably come back to typing SQLs Nicely shown. Marginally better solution than serializing arrays and then putting them into table cells like I've too-often seen.  You should use an intermediate table to relate the two entities:  -------- 1:n ------------ --------- | ITEM |-�_---------<| ITEM_TAG | n:1 | TAG | | Id | | ItemId |>-------�_-| Id | | Name | | TagId | | Name | ���������������� ������������������������ ������������������ Then for querying the data you should join your tables in a select statement: All the items in the tag ""FooTag"" SELECT item.* FROM item JOIN item_tag on item.id = item_tag.itemId JOIN tag on item_tag.tagId = tag.id WHERE tag.Name = 'FooTag' All the tags for the item with name ""FooItem"" SELECT tag.* FROM tag JOIN item_tag on tag.id = item_tag.tagId JOIN item on item_tag.itemId = item.id WHERE item.Name = 'FooItem' nice diagram :) +1  Yeah many-to-many relationship needs additional third table called association table. Database part is not that hard it's harder to use it in code with all those left joins and it can get pretty messy :) My advice is to use ORM framework like Doctrine or Propel (though I prefer Doctrine) which handle even some complex queries for you.  You're right many-to-many relationships are implemented using additional table for instance: Blog_entry(entry_id entry_body) Tag(tag_id tag_name) Entry_tag(entry_id tag_id) Any operations are being done using multiple joins. For instance if you want to select all entries with tag 'foo' using tables from my example you have to execute: select * from blog_entry tag entry_tag where tag.tag_name = 'foo' and entry_tag.tag_id = tag.tag_id and entry_tag.entry_id = blog_entry.entry_id (update) To retrieve all tags that certain entry (here with ID 123) has: select tag_name from blog_entry tag entry_tag where Blog_entry.entry_id = 123 entry_tag.tag_id = tag.tag_id and entry_tag.entry_id = blog_entry.entry_id",php sql database many-to-many,1.5403293333041476E-4,2.511990160735822E-4,0.9774762033574689,0.02211856469312719
1601613,"python contour for binary 2D matrix I want to calculate a convex hull around a shape in a binary NxM matrix. The convex hull algorithm expects a list of coordinates so I take numpy.argwhere(im) to have all shape point coordinates. However most of those points are not contributing to the convex hull (they lie on the inside of the shape). Because convex hull computation time is at least proportional to the number of points that it gets as input I devised an idea to filter the plethora of useless points on beforehand and only pass those that span the outline. The idea is quite simple that for each row in the binary NxM matrix I take only the minimal and maximal indices. So for example: im = np.array([[1110] [1011] [1101] [0000] [0111]] dtype=np.bool) outline = somefunc(im) Then outline should read (in tuples or as a 5x2 numpy array I don't mind): [(00)(02)(10)(13)(20)(23)(41)(43)] Any convex hull tight around this shape (im) must a subset of these points (outline). In other words if ""somefunc()"" is efficient in filtering the inside points then it saves time for the convex hull computation. I have code that does the above trick but I am hoping someone has a more clever (read faster) approach since I need to run it many many times. The code I have is: # I have a 2D binary field. random for the purpose of demonstration. import numpy as np im = np.random.random((320360)) > 0.9 # This is my algorithm so far. Notice that coords is sorted. coords = np.argwhere(im) left = np.roll(coords[:0] 1 axis=0) != coords[:0] outline = np.vstack([coords[left] coords[left[1:]] coords[-1]]) Another idea I had was to use Python's reduce() so I'd need to run over the list of coords only once. But I have difficulty finding a good reducing function. Any help would greatly be appreciated! edit In the meanwhile I have found a faster way to go from im directly to outline. At least with large images this is significantly faster. In the apparent absence of an external solution I am positing it as the solution to this question. Still if somebody knows an even faster method please speak up :) @Paul: Probably a good approach to complain because parts of your question are unclear and unhelpful. If we can't get your question (including your tags) we're pretty much unable to help. `fast` is not very helpful tag *sigh* I'm looking for answers wise guy. In the absence of an acceptable answer I post my best working code as the solution. def outline(im): ''' Input binary 2D (NxM) image. Ouput array (2xK) of K (yx) coordinates where 0 <= K <= 2*M. ''' topbottom = np.empty((12*im.shape[1]) dtype=np.uint16) topbottom[00:im.shape[1]] = np.argmax(im axis=0) topbottom[0im.shape[1]:] = (im.shape[0]-1)-np.argmax(np.flipud(im) axis=0) mask = np.tile(np.any(im axis=0) (2)) xvalues = np.tile(np.arange(im.shape[1]) (12)) return np.vstack([topbottomxvalues])[:mask].T  For more general solution you could use somekind of edge detection method to find only the edge points. I believe (Google..) that NumPy has built-in sobel filter which will do that. The filter will give you the bitmap/matrix where you can find all the indices like you did in your code. Oh wait you got the example image with sobel and it has too many points? yes I know the sobel filter and it is marvelous. In fact that is how I got to these binary images. the filter does not give indices however. You're right. I want to fit a polygon around the (thresholded) sobel. And therefore first I'd like to reduce the number of points. This last part is where I am trying to find fast code for. In machine vision application I've been using there's contour output in blob tool but unfortunately I don't see such feature in OpenCV. That would've been elegant solution..  This assignment seems to accomplish the same thing as your last two steps: outline = np.array(dict(reversed(coords)).items() + dict(coords).items()) Don't know if it's any faster however. Too bad it's 10 times(!) slower. That is an interesting approach. Trying it now...",python algorithm numpy contour,0.018055764507689698,0.053867053128445704,0.027060396670134403,0.9010167856937301

Access that matrix not as matrix[a b c] but as matrix[(a b) c] this is I have two variables var1 = (x y) and var2 = z and want access my matrix as matrix[var1 var2]. How can this be done? I am using numpy matrix if it makes any difference. I know I could use matrix[var1[0] var1[1] var2] but if possible I'd like to know if there is any other more elegant way. Thanks! matrix[ab][c] ? Add that as asnwer and I'll rate it. Thanks! If var1 = (xy) and var2 = z you can use matrix[var1][var2]  I think you can simply subclass the NumPy matrix type with a new class of your own; and overload the __getitem__() nethod to accept a tuple. Something like this: class SpecialMatrix(np.matrix): def __getitem__(self arg1 arg2 arg3=None): try: i j = arg1 k = arg2 assert(arg3 is None) x = super(SpecialMatrix self).__getitem__(i j k) except TypeError: assert(arg3 is not None) return super(SpecialMatrix self).__getitem__(arg1 arg2 arg3) And do something similar with __setitem__(). I'm not sure if __getitem__() takes multiple arguments like I'm showing here or if it takes a tuple or what. I don't have NumPy available as I write this answer sorry. EDIT: I re-wrote the example to use super() instead of directly calling the base class. It has been a while since I did anything with subclassing in Python. EDIT: I just looked at the accepted answer. That's totally the way to do it.

283967,How do I control the display of a JComponent's Tooltip? I have a JComponent that's painting various shapes on itself. I'm detecting whenever the mouse enters one of these shapes and changing the tooltip accordingly. The problems I'm having are: The tooltip doesn't follow the mouse as the user tracks the mouse across the shape. It stays where it was first set and then only jumps whenever another shape changes the tooltip. It takes about a second for the tooltip to appear but I'd like it to appear immediately. Can someone suggest a way of getting these behaviours without writing a custom tooltip mechanism? Take a look at the ToolTipManager. You can register your component with that manager and then adjust a number of settings. Its pretty straight forward to use. That at least can solve your initialdelay problem. For your first problem you can overide the createTooltip command from your component to get a hold of the JTooltip instance. and then its easy make the position change whenever you move your mouse(aka follow your mouse) as its a subclass of the JComponent class.  To solve your first issue of where the tooltip doesn't follow the mouse if you override the getToolTipLocation(MouseEvent e) in JComponent you can return the point for where you want to the display the tooltip. The MouseEvent will allow you to retrieve the x and y.,java swing,7.535528992364695E-4,0.8440182523828846,0.0010504320979971174,0.15417776261988186
1977737,"OpenGL Rotations around World Origin when they should be around Local Origin I'm implementing a simple camera system in OpenGL. I set up gluPerspective under the projection matrix and then use gluLookAt on the ModelView matrix. After this I have my main render loop which checks for keyboard events and if any of the arrow keys are pressed modifies angular and forward speeds (I only rotate through the y axis and move through the z (forwards)). Then I move the view using the following code (deltaTime is the amount of time since the last frame was rendered in seconds in order to decouple movement from framerate): //place our camera newTime = RunTime(); //get the time since app start deltaTime = newTime - time; //get the time since the last frame was rendered time = newTime; glRotatef(view.angularSpeed*deltaTime010); //rotate glTranslatef(00view.forwardSpeed*deltaTime); //move forwards //draw our vertices draw(); //swap buffers Swap_Buffers(); Then the code loops around again. My draw algorithm begins with a glPushMatrix() and ends in a glPopMatrix(). Each call to glRotatef() and glTranslatef() pushes the view forwards by the forwards speed in the direction of view. However when I run the code my object is drawn in the correct place but when I move the movement is done with the orientation of the world origin (000 - facing along the Z axis) as opposed to the local orientation (where I'm pointing) and when I rotate the rotation is done about (000) and not the position of the camera. I end up with this strange effect of my camera orbiting (000) as opposed to rotating on the spot. I do not call glLoadIdentity() at all anywhere inside the loop and I am sure that the Matrix Mode is set to GL_MODELVIEW for the entire loop. Another odd effect is if I put a glLoadIdentity() call inside the draw() function (between the PushMatrix and PopMatrix calls the screen just goes black and no matter where I look I can't find the object I draw. Does anybody know what I've messed up in order to make this orbit (000) instead of rotate on the spot? Thanks in advance for all of your help Please put code into code tags! glRotate() rotates the ModelView Matrix around the World Origin so to rotate around some arbitrary point you need to translate your matrix to have that point at the origin rotate and then translate back to where you started. I think what you need is this float x y z;//point you want to rotate around glTranslatef(00view.forwardSpeed*deltaTime); //move forwards glTranslatef(xyz); //translate to origin glRotatef(view.angularSpeed*deltaTime010); //rotate glTranslatef(-x-y-z); //translate back //draw our vertices draw(); //swap buffers Swap_Buffers(); Note that the comments on the 2nd and 3rd glTranslatef() calls are incorrect. They should be ""translate to origin"" and ""translate from origin"" respectively. Good catch! Thanks  Swap your rotate and translate calls around :) Since they post-multiply the matrix stack the last the be called is the 'first' to be applied conceptually if you care about that sort of thing. I tried that but it just gives the same effect. Since the rotate and translate calls all have such minute values in them and since they stack on top of each other as the while loop iterates there is little difference in their application order. Oh all your transformations are relative! If you reset the camera position each time (glLoadIdentity()) and do an absolute translation and rotation each time then things should work :)  I think you first have to translate your camera to point (000) then rotate then translate it back.",c++ opengl matrix rotation transform,0.9686758497935621,0.030667877633698454,3.4576231616062595E-4,3.105102565786823E-4

211051,"Find ""real"" height/width of Swing/AWT object Because Canvas3D doesn't have the ability to resize dynamically with the parent frame I would like to be able to track when a user resizes a window and then resize it manually myself. (If this ends up crashing Canvas3D as some docs suggest I will simply destroy and recreate it when the user resizes their window). Part of this procedure involves being able to accurately tell how big the container panel is to begin with. The two methods I've tried: panel.getHeight(); panel.getPreferredSize().height; Don't seem to accurately report things: getHeight() is invariably zero and getPreferredSize() returns numbers that don't actually have anything to do with the actual size of the panel. Any ideas? Edit: So I took a debugger to the panel object and manually inspected the non-object properties and I didn't see anything that resembled width/height. Granted there are sub-objects that I didn't look at. Also maybe the window has to be visible (it isn't at the point I'm interfacing the object) when I query for height/object? Edit 2: So Swing classes are subclasses of AWT classes so I imagine if you're able to find the height/width of those the approach would generalize. I've amended the title accordingly. I found out that if you extend by JFrame this code can be used also to save time effort and space. int windowWidth = getWidth(); int windowHeight = getHeight(); I know you already got an answer but if you ever need an alternative here it is.  To determine the size of a component you have to either: have set it manually at some point run the layout manager responsible for layouting the component Generally you get the exact size of a component via the getSize() method which returns a Dimension object containing width and height but getWidth/Height() should work too. But this can only work if one of the two preconditions are met. If a window has never been made visible has no layout manager or the component (you want to know the size of) has been added after the window/container has been made visible the size usually is zero. So to get the correct size you have to make the container/frame visible (after you have added the component) or call validate() or doLayout() on the container to recalculate the layout if you added the component after the last layout was done. Another thing to keep in mind is setting and probably configuring a layout manager on the container. If no layout manager ist set (null) even making a container visible oder calling validate() does not set a size on its children. The minimumSize/preferredSize/maximumSize properties are hints to the layout manager how the component should be sized but it does not have to obey them (most layout managers don't). Edit 2: After I read your other question about the same subject I think you should read Using Layout Managers from The Java Tutorials Edit: I don't know if you already figured that out but to react to the resizing of the window you can do something like this: public class WindowResizeTest extends JFrame { public static void main(String[] args) { new WindowResizeTest(); } public WindowResizeTest() { this.setSize(640 480); JPanel panel = new JPanel(); panel.setBackground(Color.RED); this.add(panel); this.addComponentListener(new ComponentListener() { public void componentResized(ComponentEvent e) { System.out.println(e.getComponent().getSize()); } public void componentHidden(ComponentEvent e) {} public void componentMoved(ComponentEvent e) {} public void componentShown(ComponentEvent e) {} }); this.setVisible(true); } } Thank you so much for the well thought out answer.

790960,"How to synthesize sounds? I'd like to produce sounds that would resemble audio from real instruments. The problem is that I have very little clue how to get that. What I know this far from real instruments is that sounds they output are rarely clean. But how to produce such unclean sounds? This far I've gotten to do this it produces quite plain sound from which I'm not sure it's even using the alsa correctly. import numpy from numpy.fft import fft ifft from numpy.random import random_sample from alsaaudio import PCM PCM_NONBLOCK PCM_FORMAT_FLOAT_LE pcm = PCM()#mode=PCM_NONBLOCK) pcm.setrate(44100) pcm.setformat(PCM_FORMAT_FLOAT_LE) pcm.setchannels(1) pcm.setperiodsize(4096) def sine_wave(x freq=100): sample = numpy.arange(x*4096 (x+1)*4096 dtype=numpy.float32) sample *= numpy.pi * 2 / 44100 sample *= freq return numpy.sin(sample) for x in xrange(1000): sample = sine_wave(x 100) pcm.write(sample.tostring()) As other people said not a trivial topic at all. There are challenges both at the programming side of things (especially if you care about low-latency) and the synthesis part. A goldmine for sound synthesis is the page by Julius O. Smith. There is a lot of techniques for synthesis http://ccrma-www.stanford.edu/~jos/.  Sound synthesis is a complex topic which requires many years of study to master. It is also not an entirely solved problem although relatively recent developments (such as physical modelling synthesis) have made progress in imitating real-world instruments. There are a number of options open to you. If you are sure that you want to explore synthesis further then I suggest you start by learning about FM synthesis. It is relatively easy to learn and implement in software at least in basic forms and produces a wide range of interesting sounds. Also check out the book ""The Computer Music Tutorial"" by Curtis Roads. It's a bible for all things computer music and although it's a few years old it is the book of choice for learning the fundamentals. If you want a quicker way to produce life-like sound consider using sampling techniques: that is record the instruments you want to reproduce (or use a pre-existing sample bank) and just play back the samples. It's a much more straightforward (and often more effective) approach. I wouldn't like to use sample banks. I want something that resembles instruments not life-like at all.  Cheery if you want to generate (from scratch) something that really sounds ""organic"" i.e. like a physical object you're probably best off to learn a bit about how these sounds are generated. For a solid introduction you could have a look at a book such as Fletcher and Rossings The Physics of Musical Instruments. There's lots of stuff on the web too you might want to have a look at a the primer James Clark has here Having at least a skim over this sort of stuff will give you an idea of what you are up against. Modeling physical instruments accurately is very difficult! If what you want to do is have something that sounds physical rather something that sounds like instrument X your job is a bit easier.

327642,"OpenGL and monochrome texture Is it possible to pump monochrome (graphical data with 1 bit image depth) texture into OpenGL? I'm currently using this: glTexImage2D( GL_TEXTURE_2D 0 1 game->width game->height 0 GL_LUMINANCE GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE game->culture[game->phase] ); I'm pumping it with square array of 8 bit unsigned integers in GL_LUMINANCE mode (one 8 bit channel represents brightness of all 3 channels and full alpha) but it is IMO vastly ineffective because the onlu values in the array are 0x00 and 0xFF. Can I (and how) use simple one-bit per pixel array of booleans instead somehow? The excessive array size slows down any other operations on the array :( After some research I was able to render the 1-bit per pixel image as a texture with the following code: static GLubyte smiley[] = /* 16x16 smiley face */ { 0x03 0xc0 /* **** */ 0x0f 0xf0 /* ******** */ 0x1e 0x78 /* **** **** */ 0x39 0x9c /* *** ** *** */ 0x77 0xee /* *** ****** *** */ 0x6f 0xf6 /* ** ******** ** */ 0xff 0xff /* **************** */ 0xff 0xff /* **************** */ 0xff 0xff /* **************** */ 0xff 0xff /* **************** */ 0x73 0xce /* *** **** *** */ 0x73 0xce /* *** **** *** */ 0x3f 0xfc /* ************ */ 0x1f 0xf8 /* ********** */ 0x0f 0xf0 /* ******** */ 0x03 0xc0 /* **** */ }; float index[] = {0.0 1.0}; glPixelStorei(GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT1); glPixelMapfv(GL_PIXEL_MAP_I_TO_R 2 index); glPixelMapfv(GL_PIXEL_MAP_I_TO_G 2 index); glPixelMapfv(GL_PIXEL_MAP_I_TO_B 2 index); glPixelMapfv(GL_PIXEL_MAP_I_TO_A 2 index); glTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D0GL_RGBA16160GL_COLOR_INDEXGL_BITMAPsmiley); glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER GL_LINEAR); glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER GL_LINEAR); and here is the result: Nice! Have you compared its performance to the 1 byte per pixel variant? I found swapping the internal format to `LUMINANCE` produces the same visuals with a quarter the memory. If there are any formats smaller I would be interested. Idk how to get S3TC formats. I don't think pyOpenGL has those extensions. It does not appear that you can clamp this texture without it changing shape. I was just trying to get rid of the cross border bleeding.  The smallest uncompressed texture-format for luminance images uses 8 bits per pixel. However 1 bit per pixel images can be compressed without loss to the S3TC or DXT format. This will still not be 1 bit per pixel but somewhere between 2 and 3 bits. If you really need 1 bit per pixel you can do so with a little trick. Load 8 1 bit per pixel textures as one 8 bit Alpha-only texture (image 1 gets loaded into bit 1 image 2 into bit 2 and so on). Once you've done that you can ""address"" each of the sub-textures using the alpha-test feature and a bit of texture environment programming to turn alpha into a color. This will of only work if you have 8 1 bit per pixel textures and tricky to get right though. The 8 textures trick sounds interesting but it is not really what I am looking for.

I only know that when I try the same thing with recarrays I get a ValueError: cannot resize this array: it does not own its own data.

890529,Returning multiple rows per row (in Zend Framework) I have a MySQL database containing these tables: sessions -------- sessionid (INT) [courseid (INT)] [locationid (INT)] [comment (TEXT)] dates ----- dateid (INT) sessionid (INT) date (DATE) courses ------- ... locations --------- ... Each session has a unique sessionid and each date has a unique dateid. But dates don't necessarily have a unique sessionid as a session can span over a variable number of dates (not necessarily consecutive). Selecting each full row is simply a matter of joining the tables on the sessionid. However I'm looking for a way to return a rowset for a particular courseid where each row in that rowset represents a location and contains another rowset each containing single session which in turn contains another rowset which contains all of the dates for that session: course location sesssion date date session date date date location ... This is because I'm using querying this database from PHP using Zend Framework which has a great interface for manipulating rows and rowsets in an object-oriented manner. Ultimately I'm trying to output a 'schedule' to the view organized first by course then location then date. Ideally I'd be able iterate over each row as a location and then for each location iterate over each session and then for each session iterate over each date. I'm thinking of doing this by querying for all the locations sessions and dates separately. Then I'd convert each rowset into an array and add each sessions array as a member of a locations array and add each dates array as a member of a sessions array. This however feels very kludgy and doesn't provide me with the ability to handle the rows in an object-oriented manner. I was wondering if there was either: a) a better table schema for representing this data; b) an sql query which i'm not aware of; c) a method in Zend_Db that allows me to assign a rowset to a rowset Please let me know if I haven't been clear anywhere and thanks in advance. (Crossing my fingers that this doesn't end up on the daily wtf...) You could handle this scenario using the relationship features of Zend_ Db_ Table. You'd need to create table wrapper classes for sessions dates courses etc. if you're using Zend_ Db_ Aadpter for your queries currently. http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.table.relationships.html It's not too different from the approach you described of querying for each dataset separately but it gives you a straight forward OO interface for retrieving the appropriate related data for a given record. You'll want to do some benchmarking if you go this route as it could potentially execute a lot of queries.  I've run into lots of issues with using Zend Frameworks database abstraction classes when I have to deal with data from multiple tables. The number of queries that run and the overhead of all of the objects generated has brought my hosting server to it's knees. I've since reverted back to writing queries to gather all of my data and then walking the data to build my display. It's not a pretty or OO as using the abstraction layers but it's also not making my PHP scripts page to disk just to display a table full of data. As Steve mentions benchmark whatever solution you end up with I'd also profile your memory usage. +1 I agree and I contributed quite a bit to the Zend Framework DB classes.

If it continues to fail either your drivers are whack or you're using a command not supported by your card. On the other hand if your screen looks right when using your code compiled on his machine then your static libraries have a problem. Yes you're right it is a drivers issue.

723762,"Programs causing static noise in speakers? Does anyone know a reason why my programs could be causing my speakers to output some soft static? The programs themselves don't have a single element that outputs sound to anything yet when I run a few of my programs I can hear a static coming from my speakers. It even gets louder when I run certain programs. Moving the speakers around doesn't help so it must be coming from inside the computer. I'm not sure what other details to put down since this seems very odd. They are OpenGL programs written in C++ with MS Visual C++. Edit: It seems to be that swapping the framebuffers inside an infinite loop is making the noise as when I stop swapping I get silence... I get exactly the same thing with a number of programs - particularly with ObjectDock (a Mac Dock imitation for Windows) - but only when I move my mouse if the cursor is over the dock. Quite strange. I don't know if ObjectDock is supposed to do that - seems weird that it would. Since you say you don't touch sound in your programs I doubt it's your code doing this. Does it occur if you run any other graphics-intensive programs? Also what happens if you mute various channels in the mixer (sndvol32.exe on 32-bit windows)? Not knowing anything else I'd venture a guess that it could be related to the fan on your graphics card. If your programs cause the fan to turn on and it's either close to your sound card or the fan's power line crosses an audio cable it could cause some static. Try moving any audio cables as far as possible from the fan and power cables and see what happens. It could also be picking up static from a number of other sources and I wouldn't say it's necessarily unusual. If non-graphics-intensive programs cause this as well it could be hard-disk access or even certain frequencies of CPU/power usage being picked up on an audio line like an antenna. You can also try to reduce the number of loops in your audio wires and see if it helps but no guarantees. I opened Sim City muted game sounds and I heard the same static. I guess I never noticed because I always play with sound. =/ Turns out it was some power wires hanging over my sound card. I moved them and silence!  Most electronic devices give off some kind of electromagnetic interference. Your speakers or sound hardware may be picking up something as simple as the signaling on your video cable or the graphics card itself. Cheap speakers and poorly-protected audio devices tend to be fairly sensitive to this kind of radiation in my experience.  There is interference on your motherboard that is leaking onto your sound bus. This is usually because of the quality of your motherboard or the age of it. Also the layout of the equipment inside your computer (close together over lapping) often will make interesting EM fields. My old laptop used to do this a lot easier as it got older. So as things are winding up or down you'll hear it. Try to see if it happens on a different computer. Try different computers of different ages and different configurations (external soundcard or a physical sound card etc). Hope that helps.  Computers consume a different amount of power when executing code. This fluctuation of current acts like a RF transmitter and can be picked up by audio equipment and it will be essentially ""decoded"" much like a AM modulated signal. As the execution usually does not produce a recognizable signal it sounds like white noise. A good example of audio equippment picking up a RF signal is if you hold your (GSM) cell phone close to an audio amplifier when receiving a call. You most likely will hear a characteristic pumping buzz from the cell phone's transmitter. Go here to learn more about Electromagnetic compatibility. There are multiple ways a signal can couple into your audio. As you mentioned a power cord to be the source it was most likely magnetic inductive coupling. This is exactly what it is. You either need better sheilding on your cables/speakers or on your computer. If your PC case is plastic it won't block any RF generated from within. If the case is steel it acts like a Faraday Cage. I don't think thats the reason. The current level is too low in the circuits to cause audible sound. Also there is no system in the computer which is built to catch RF frequency. This noise should be generated by actually getting a electric signal.  :) You will be surprised to know that the speaker input is picking up static from the hard disk. When you do something memory/disk intensive (like swapping framebuffers) so that the hard disk has to rotate fast the sound will appear. I had the same problem some years back I solved it too. But I am sorry that I don't remember how I did it. Hope the diagnosis helps in remedying the problem. UPDATE: I remembered. If you are using Windows go to volume control and mute all the external inputs/outputs like CD input etc. Just keep the two basic ones.  Crappy audio hardware on motherboards especially the ones that end up in office PCs. The interior of a PC case is full of electrical noise. If that couples to the audio hardware you'll hear it. Solution: Get a pair of headphones with a volume control on the cord. Turn the volume on the headphones down and turn the volume on the PC up full. This will increase the signal level relative to the noise level in most cases.  tempest dvbt",c++ opengl audio,0.7100819732075635,0.08571695816888625,2.253032765894865E-4,0.20397576534696085
773030,"Why are 0d arrays in Numpy not considered scalar? Surely a 0d array is scalar but Numpy does not seem to think so... am I missing something or am I just misunderstanding the concept? >>> foo = numpy.array(1.11111111111 numpy.float64) >>> numpy.ndim(foo) 0 >>> numpy.isscalar(foo) False >>> foo.item() 1.11111111111 One should not think too hard about it. It's ultimately better for the mental health and longevity of the individual. The curious situation with Numpy scalar-types was bore out of the fact that there is no graceful and consistent way to degrade the 1x1 matrix to scalar types. Even though mathematically they are the same thing they are handled by very different code. If you've been doing any amount of scientific code ultimately you'd want things like max(a) to work on matrices of all sizes even scalars. Mathematically this is a perfectly sensible thing to expect. However for programmers this means that whatever presents scalars in Numpy should have the .shape and .ndim attirbute so at least the ufuncs don't have to do explicit type checking on its input for the 21 possible scalar types in Numpy. On the other hand they should also work with existing Python libraries that does do explicit type-checks on scalar type. This is a dilemma since a Numpy ndarray have to individually change its type when they've been reduced to a scalar and there is no way of knowing whether that has occurred without it having do checks on all access. Actually going that route would probably make bit ridiculously slow to work with by scalar type standards. The Numpy developer's solution is to inherit from both ndarray and Python scalars for its own scalary type so that all scalars also have .shape .ndim .T etc etc. The 1x1 matrix will still be there but its use will be discouraged if you know you'll be dealing with a scalar. While this should work fine in theory occasionally you could still see some places where they missed with the paint roller and the ugly innards are exposed for all to see: >>> from numpy import * >>> a = array(1) >>> b = int_(1) >>> a.ndim 0 >>> b.ndim 0 >>> a[...] array(1) >>> a[()] 1 >>> b[...] array(1) >>> b[()] array(1) There's really no reason why a[...] and a[()] should return different things but it does. There are proposals in place to change this but looks like they forgot to finish the job for 1x1 arrays. A potentially bigger and possibly non-resolvable issue is the fact that Numpy scalars are immutable. Therefore ""spraying"" a scalar into a ndarray mathematically the adjoint operation of collapsing an array into a scalar is a PITA to implement. You can't actually grow a Numpy scalar it cannot by definition be cast into an ndarray even though newaxis mysteriously works on it: >>> b[0123] = 1 Traceback (most recent call last): File ""<stdin>"" line 1 in <module> TypeError: 'numpy.int32' object does not support item assignment >>> b[newaxis] array([1]) In Matlab growing the size of a scalar is a perfectly acceptable and brainless operation. In Numpy you have to stick jarring a = array(a) everywhere you think you'd have the possibility of starting with a scalar and ending up with an array. I understand why Numpy has to be this way to play nice with Python but that doesn't change the fact that many new switchers are deeply confused about this. Some have explicit memory of struggling with this behaviour and eventually persevering while others who are too far gone are generally left with some deep shapeless mental scar that frequently haunts their most innocent dreams. It's an ugly situation for all. +1 for the philosophical introduction :-) Have you considered a writing side career?  You have to create the scalar array a little bit differently: >>> x = numpy.float64(1.111) >>> x 1.111 >>> numpy.isscalar(x) True >>> numpy.ndim(x) 0 It looks like scalars in numpy may be a bit different concept from what you may be used to from a purely mathematical standpoint.

Consider that I have 6 parameters [ a b c d e f] in the Initial values and my constraints are: a<=e<=1.4*a ('e' varies from a to 1.4*a) b<=f<=1.4*b ('f' varies from b to 1.4*b) c>d ('c' must always be greater than d) But this is not working properly. I don't know what the mistake is. Is there any better way to pass my constraints as a function? Please help me. I don't know numpy but are a and b negative? otherwise I can't seee how any values of e and f can satisfy 1.4*a <= e <= a and 1.4*b <= f <= b. It would help if you state clearly what it is exactly that you are doing what is it you want to happen and what actually happens instead of just pasting a code fragment. @pear I've tried to answer your question but as hughdbrown says the constraints in your code above don't seem to work for positive numbers. Maybe the signs are backwards on the first two? Sorry all are positive values greater than 0. I have changed i hope its correct. Based on the comment from Robert Kern I have removed my previous answer. Here are the constraints as continuous functions: b1 = lambda x: x[4]-x[0] if x[4]<1.2*x[0] else 1.4*x[0]-x[4] b2 = lambda x: x[5]-x[1] if x[5]<1.2*x[1] else 1.4*x[1]-x[5] b3 = lambda x: x[2]-x[3] Note: Python 2.5 or greater is required for this syntax.1 To get the constraint a<=e<=1.4*a note that 1.2*a is the halfway point between a and 1.4*a. Below this point that is all e<1.2*a we use the continuous function e-a. Thus the overall constraint function is negative when e<a handling the lower out-of-bounds condition zero on the lower boundary e==a and then positive for e>a up to the halfway point. Above the halfway point that is all e>1.2*a we use instead the continuous function 1.4*a-e. This means the overall constraint function is is negative when e>1.4*a handling the upper out-of-bounds condition zero on the upper boundary e==1.4*a and then positive when e<1.4*a down to the halfway point. At the halfway point where e==1.2*a both functions have the same value. This means that the overall function is continuous. Reference: documentation for ieqcons. 1 - Here is pre-Python 2.5 syntax: b1 = lambda x: (1.4*x[0]-x[4] x[4]-x[0])[x[4]<1.2*x[0]] system Pause as Robert says function has to continuous. so i have made lambda x: ([1.4*x[0] - x[0]]) ie.lambda x:(max-min). But what am i made is correct or not i don't know. @system Pause Thank you it seems b1 and b2 are working good but b3 = lambda x: x[2]-x[3] not working as expected.For example some times func() passes [150 192 1.8487 2.07364 194 216] here b1 and b2 are well defined but b3 is violated. Like this it happens couple of times.what to do? any better way of defining 'b2'? No this will not work. The constraint functions should be continuous as much as possible >0 when they are satisfied <0 when they are not and ==0 when they are precisely on the boundary. @pear Sorry I don't know why `b3` is violated. Subtracting `c-d` (aka `x[2]-x[3]`) is a continuous function that is be positive when `c>d` and zero/negative when `c<=d`. But clearly 1.8487 < 2.07364 so I am stumped. @pear I don't think that can be correct as it does not use *e* (aka `x[4]`) at all in the expression. That expression is equivalent to `1.4*a - a` which is always going to have the value `0.4a`.,python lambda numpy scipy,3.864267927932418E-4,6.301901030859957E-4,5.3866836301392E-4,0.9984447147411069
363302,openGL textures that are not 2^x in dimention I'm trying to display a picture in an openGL environment. The picture's origninal dimensions are 3648x2432 and I want to display it with a 256x384 image. The problem is 384 is not a power of 2 and when I try to display it it looks stretched. How can I fix that? If GL_EXT_texture_rectangle is true then use GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE_EXT for the first param in glEnable() and GLBindTexture() calls.  You can resize your texture so it is a power of two (skew your texture so that when it is mapped onto the object it looks correct). I am under the impression that textures are always a power of two because the hardware would use the same amount of resources anyways. But I could be incorrect. Yes this is incorrect in modern hardware.  There's three ways of doing this that I know of - The one Albert suggested (resize it until it fits). Subdivide the texture into 2**n-sized rectangles and piece them together in some way. See if you can use GL_ARB_texture_non_power_of_two. It's probably best to avoid it though since it looks like it's an Xorg-specific extension. Option 2 is great - prevents loss of fidelity  ARB_texture_rectangle is probably what you're looking for. It lets you bind to GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE_ARB instead of GL_TEXTURE_2D and you can load an image with non power-of-2 dimensions. Be aware that your texture coordinates will range from [0..w]x[0..h] instead of [0..1]x[0..1].,c++ opengl ldf,0.9717566517039247,0.001024766102352333,0.026431947795522114,7.866343982007854E-4
366742,Creating an Environment Stack in OpenGL I'd like to create an abstraction in OpenGL of the environment settings(blending stenciling depth etc.) that works like the matrix stack. Push onto the stack make any changes you need draw your objects then pop the stack and go back to the prior settings. For example currently you might have drawing code like this: glEnable(GL_BLEND); glBlendFunc(GL_SRC_ALPHA GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA); glDisable(GL_DEPTH_TEST); //Draw operations glEnable(GL_DEPTH_TEST); glDisable(GL_BLEND); But with an environment stack it would look like this: glPushEnv(); glEnable(GL_BLEND); glBlendFunc(GL_SRC_ALPHA GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA); glDisable(GL_DEPTH_TEST); //Draw operations glPopEnv(); As I see it there are only 2 ways to do this: Create my own 'flavor' of each environment setting function and call that. It will in turn update the current EnvStack data structure and call the OpenGL environment function. Alter the OpenGL environment functions to point to my environment functions which will again update the current EnvStack data structure and call the original OpenGL environment functions. So option 1 is obviously much simpler. But I run into a problem if I'm using other peoples code in that I don't necessarily know what changes it's making to the environement and therefor my data structure would be out of sync. And since the whole point is to have a simple method of ensuring the environment settings are correct this is not cool. So my question is in this context how do I change the functions that the OpenGL environment functions point to? OpenGL already contains this functionality. You want glPushAttrib(GL_ALL_ATTRIB_BITS); and glPopAttrib();. See http://opengl.org/documentation/specs/man_pages/hardcopy/GL/html/gl/pushattrib.html for more. Wow. I have never come across that.

115103,"How do you implement position-sensitive zooming inside a JScrollPane? I am trying to implement position-sensitive zooming inside a JScrollPane. The JScrollPane contains a component with a customized 'paint' that will draw itself inside whatever space it is allocated - so zooming is as easy as using a MouseWheelListener that resizes the inner component as required. But I also want zooming into (or out of) a point to keep that point as central as possible within the resulting zoomed-in (or -out) view (this is what I refer to as 'position-sensitive' zooming) similar to how zooming works in google maps. I am sure this has been done many times before - does anybody know the ""right"" way to do it under Java Swing?. Would it be better to play with Graphic2D's transformations instead of using JScrollPanes? Sample code follows: package test; import java.awt.*; import java.awt.event.*; import java.awt.geom.*; import javax.swing.*; public class FPanel extends javax.swing.JPanel { private Dimension preferredSize = new Dimension(400 400); private Rectangle2D[] rects = new Rectangle2D[50]; public static void main(String[] args) { JFrame jf = new JFrame(""test""); jf.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE); jf.setSize(400 400); jf.add(new JScrollPane(new FPanel())); jf.setVisible(true); } public FPanel() { // generate rectangles with pseudo-random coords for (int i=0; i<rects.length; i++) { rects[i] = new Rectangle2D.Double( Math.random()*.8 Math.random()*.8 Math.random()*.2 Math.random()*.2); } // mouse listener to detect scrollwheel events addMouseWheelListener(new MouseWheelListener() { public void mouseWheelMoved(MouseWheelEvent e) { updatePreferredSize(e.getWheelRotation() e.getPoint()); } }); } private void updatePreferredSize(int n Point p) { double d = (double) n * 1.08; d = (n > 0) ? 1 / d : -d; int w = (int) (getWidth() * d); int h = (int) (getHeight() * d); preferredSize.setSize(w h); getParent().doLayout(); // Question: how do I keep 'p' centered in the resulting view? } public Dimension getPreferredSize() { return preferredSize; } private Rectangle2D r = new Rectangle2D.Float(); public void paint(Graphics g) { super.paint(g); g.setColor(Color.red); int w = getWidth(); int h = getHeight(); for (Rectangle2D rect : rects) { r.setRect(rect.getX() * w rect.getY() * h rect.getWidth() * w rect.getHeight() * h); ((Graphics2D)g).draw(r); } } } Added bounty to see if I can get a full answer (ideally: the code snippet that when added above answers the question). Tested this seems to work... private void updatePreferredSize(int n Point p) { double d = (double) n * 1.08; d = (n > 0) ? 1 / d : -d; int w = (int) (getWidth() * d); int h = (int) (getHeight() * d); preferredSize.setSize(w h); int offX = (int)(p.x * d) - p.x; int offY = (int)(p.y * d) - p.y; setLocation(getLocation().x-offXgetLocation().y-offY); getParent().doLayout(); } Update Here is an explanation: the point p is the location of the mouse relative to the FPanel. Since you are scaling the size of the panel the location of p (relative to the size of the panel) will scale by the same factor. By subtracting the current location from the scaled location you get how much the point 'shifts' when the panel is resized. Then it is simply a matter of shifting the panel location in the scroll pane by the same amount in the opposite direction to put p back under the mouse cursor. Exactly what I was looking for. Thanks!  Your MouseWheelListener also has to locate the cursor move it to the center of the JScrollPane and adjust the xmin/ymin and xmax/ymax of the content to be viewed. Yes that is true - it is also what I was trying to do in the first place (the cursor is located at 'p' and adjusting those bounds correctly is what I do not know how to do).  I think smt like this should be working...  private void updatePreferredSize(int n Point p) { double d = (double) n * 1.08; d = (n > 0) ? 1 / d : -d; int w = (int) (getWidth() * d); int h = (int) (getHeight() * d); preferredSize.setSize(w h); // Question: how do I keep 'p' centered in the resulting view? int parentWdt = this.getParent( ).getWidth( ) ; int parentHgt = this.getParent( ).getHeight( ) ; int newLeft = p.getLocation( ).x - ( p.x - ( parentWdt / 2 ) ) ; int newTop = p.getLocation( ).y - ( p.y - ( parentHgt / 2 ) ) ; this.setLocation( newLeft newTop ) ; getParent().doLayout(); } EDIT: Changed a couple things. Your code does not keep the point 'p' centered in the resulting view (for an example try zooming near the bottom-right corner) even after changing `int newTop = p.y - w / 2;` to `int newTop = p.y - h / 2;`. Please test code before proposing it as an answer. The updated code seems to zoom into the top-left corner (java 6 on XP) not into wherever the mouse pointer is pointing. I am using the same test program listed in the question.

I simply have no idea how to formulate this question or what to Google after so don't shoot me if this is something easy answerable. Assume I have the following tables: [AUTHORS] id name [NEWS] id item author_id If I wanted to display a news item and output the corresponding author (stored in author_id) I'd do the following query: SELECT * FROM `news` JOIN `authors` ON news.author_id = authors.id And then outputting it by doing something like this $Q = ""SELECT * FROM news JOIN authors ON news.author_id=news.id""; $query = $this->lite->query($Q) or die($this->lite->error); $result=null; while($obj = $query->fetch_object()){ $result.= '<li>'.$obj->item. 'by ' . $obj->name . '</li>'; } Here $obj->name would contain the name of the author and would successfully output. So what happens if the ""name"" field were called ""item"" instead? There would obviously be some conflicts. With my previous experience in Propel & symfony I would do something like this: getAuthorId()->getName() - but for this project I'm required to write SQL from scratch. Can you give more details about your class? Does it's fetching all params in object? You would need to use a qualified name like news.item or authors.item.  Never use * syntax in production code. Rewrite your query as this: SELECT news.item AS news_item author.name AS author_name FROM `news` JOIN `authors` ON news.author_id = authors.id  aliasing your fields as necessary to avoid naming conflicts. Many thanks! This did the trick. This is not production code of course :-)  You name them explicitly SELECT n.id n.item n.author_ida.namea.id FROM `news` as n JOIN `authors` as a ON n.author_id = n.id ; Or perhaps more like SELECT n.id as newsid n.item as newsitem n.author_id as autohor_authorid a.name as authornamea.id as authorid FROM `news` as n JOIN `authors` as a ON n.author_id = n.id; You should only pull out the columns you actually need.

2186091,mySQL Table Structure for a User-based website I am developing a website that has user profiles accounts account settings inboxes etc. just like Facebook or LinkedIn and I'm wondering how to set up the mySQL tables for it. Should I create a table for every user for each function (profile inbox etc.)? In short yes each function should be in one table if there is aneed to. On edit: And not a table for every user. One record in each corresponding table The concept this deals with is normalization. Consider profile and inbox. A user has only one profile but would have numerous messages in the inbox. It makes sense to have the inbox as another table with each message being identified by a message-id and its owner then its content.  You really need to think about everything you put into a database in terms of relationships (as mentioned by other posters). In the example you gave a user is going to have a one to many relationship with things like mail they will have a one to one relationship with their user profile and they will have a many to one relationship with something like 'locations' where many users live in one city. As you are designing your database always ask yourself which relationship type you need to build and make an attempt to never duplicate data in multiple tables when you don't need to. When you set up something like a users table make sure that every row is equal to a user (as opposed to every user being a table) and that every row has a unique auto-increment id. This user id (that is generated by MySQL) is going to be the reference that you use in other tables to link your data together. So when you setup your mail table you might have 15 rows containing email data but each of those rows will contain a field named something like user_id that will contain the unique id of that user from the users table. Start getting familiar with things like LEFT JOIN--this is how you will run a single query and get for example your user's data AND all of his email at once.  You wouldn't create a table for every user. You would create a record and a unique id for each user and then relate that user to other tables using the ID as a foreign key in other tables.,php sql mysql database table,4.0223034326400116E-4,6.559627495122525E-4,0.9984382745777289,5.035323294947281E-4

This is probably not the case since you're working with an in-memory surface but normally you need to lock surfaces before accessing their pixel data with SDL_LockSurface(). For example: bool lock = SDL_MUSTLOCK(texture); if(lock) SDL_LockSurface(texture); // should check that return value == 0 // access pixel data e.g. call glTexImage2D if(lock) SDL_UnlockSUrface(texture);  If you have an alpha chanel every pixel is 4 unsigned bytes if you don't it's 3 unsigned bytes. This image has no transpareny and when I try to save it its a .jpg. change glTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D 0 GL_RGBA texture->w texture->h 0 GL_RGB GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE texture-> pixels); to glTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D 0 GL_RGB texture->w texture->h 0 GL_RGB GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE texture-> pixels); That should fix it. For a .png with an alpha channel use glTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D 0 GL_RGBA texture->w texture->h 0 GL_RGBA GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE texture-> pixels); this is actually wrong. the parameter you're modifying is used to tell GL what format to _store_ the texture as. storing to RGBA when your input is RGB is perfectly valid it sets A=1 for all texels.",c++ opengl sdl sdl-image,0.9469715227694206,0.05246340924903988,2.9771046696310547E-4,2.673575145763677E-4
442218,How do I use a 2-d boolean array to select from a 1-d array on a per-row basis in numpy? Let me illustrate this question with an example: import numpy matrix = numpy.identity(5 dtype=bool) #Using identity as a convenient way to create an array with the invariant that there will only be one True value per row the solution should apply to any array with this invariant base = numpy.arange(5305) #This could be any 1-d array provided its length is the same as the length of axis=1 of matrix from above result = numpy.array([ base[line] for line in matrix ]) result now holds the desired result but I'm sure there is a numpy-specific method for doing this that avoids the explicit iteration. What is it? Here is another ugly way of doing it: n.apply_along_axis(base.__getitem__ 0 matrix).reshape((51))  If I understand your question correctly you can simply use matrix multiplication: result = numpy.dot(matrix base) If the result must have the same shape as in your example just add a reshape: result = numpy.dot(matrix base).reshape((51)) If the matrix is not symmetric be careful about the order in dot.

482041,"How to select first item in JPopupMenu? In the past when one made a JPopupMenu visible it's first item would get selected by default: http://weblogs.java.net/blog/alexfromsun/archive/2008/02/jtrayicon_updat.html Nowadays the default behavior is to pop up the menu without any item selected. I would like create a JPopupMenu with a single item that will pop up selected and centered under the mouse pointer. I have managed to get the item to pop up centered under the mouse but I the JMenuItem refuses to render as if it is selected. If I move the mouse out of the item and back in it selects properly. Any ideas? Here is my testcase: import java.awt.Component; import java.awt.Point; import java.awt.event.ActionEvent; import java.awt.event.ActionListener; import java.awt.event.MouseAdapter; import java.awt.event.MouseEvent; import javax.swing.JFrame; import javax.swing.JMenuItem; import javax.swing.JPopupMenu; public class Test extends JFrame { public static void main(String[] args) { JFrame frame = new JFrame(); frame.setSize(800 600); frame.getContentPane().addMouseListener(new MouseAdapter() { @Override public void mousePressed(MouseEvent e) { if (e.isPopupTrigger()) popupTriggered(e); } @Override public void mouseReleased(MouseEvent e) { if (e.isPopupTrigger()) popupTriggered(e); } private void popupTriggered(MouseEvent e) { JPopupMenu menu = new JPopupMenu(); final JMenuItem item = new JMenuItem(""This is a JMenuItem""); menu.add(item); Point point = e.getPoint(); int x = point.x - (item.getPreferredSize().width / 2); int y = point.y - (item.getPreferredSize().height / 2); menu.show((Component) e.getSource() x y); } }); frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.DISPOSE_ON_CLOSE); frame.setVisible(true); } } I found some inconsistent behavior too (see my updated answer). Can you confirm this? I reported this as a bug to Sun. I'll let you know what they write back. Here is the associated bug report: http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6799989 Secret turns out to be MenuSelectionManager.defaultManager().setSelectedPath(new MenuElement[]{menu ...}); import java.awt.event.MouseAdapter; import java.awt.event.MouseEvent; import javax.swing.JFrame; import javax.swing.JMenuItem; import javax.swing.JPopupMenu; import javax.swing.MenuElement; import javax.swing.MenuSelectionManager; import javax.swing.SwingUtilities; /** * Demonstrates programmatic {@link JMenuItem} selection; * specifically how to make the first item selected by default */ public class TestPopup extends JFrame { public static void main(String[] args) { final JFrame frame = new JFrame(""TestPopup""); frame.setSize(640 480); frame.getContentPane().addMouseListener(new MouseAdapter() { @Override public void mousePressed(MouseEvent e) { if (e.isPopupTrigger()) { popupTriggered(e); } } private void popupTriggered(MouseEvent e) { final JPopupMenu menu = new JPopupMenu(); final JMenuItem item0 = new JMenuItem(""JMenuItem 0""); final JMenuItem item1 = new JMenuItem(""JMenuItem 1""); menu.add(item0); menu.add(item1); menu.pack(); // use invokeLater or just do this after the menu has been shown SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable() { public void run() { MenuSelectionManager.defaultManager().setSelectedPath(new MenuElement[]{menu item0}); } }); int x = (int) ((int) (frame.getSize().width - (menu.getPreferredSize().width / 2.)) / 2.); int y = (int) ((int) (frame.getSize().height - (menu.getPreferredSize().height / 2.)) / 2.); menu.show(frame x y); // doesn't work: //item0.setSelected(true); // doesn't work: //menu.getSelectionModel().setSelectedIndex(0); // bingo; see also MenuKeyListener / MenuKeyEvent // MenuSelectionManager.defaultManager().setSelectedPath(new MenuElement[]{menu item0}); } }); frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.DISPOSE_ON_CLOSE); frame.setLocationRelativeTo(null); frame.setVisible(true); } }  This is weird. I tried it with Windows and with Java 1.5.0_08 and even 1.6.0_07 the first Element is selected automatically as you expected it to be. So I tried it with 1.6.0_11 and it does not work any more the first element is not selected initially. Selecting the element in the selectionModel does not seem to help. One workaround (that I'm not at all proud of) is to move the mouse automatically after displaying the popup menu using the coordinates of the MouseEvent. Maybe someone's got a better idea? import java.awt.AWTException; import java.awt.Robot; import java.awt.event.MouseAdapter; import java.awt.event.MouseEvent; import javax.swing.JFrame; import javax.swing.JMenuItem; import javax.swing.JPopupMenu; public class SelectedPopupMenu extends JFrame { public SelectedPopupMenu() { addMouseListener(new MouseAdapter() { public void mouseClicked(final MouseEvent e) { JPopupMenu popupMenu = new JPopupMenu(); popupMenu.add(new JMenuItem(""Test-Item"")); popupMenu.add(new JMenuItem(""Test-Item-2"")); // do not care to really hit the center of the popup popupMenu.show(SelectedPopupMenu.this e.getX() - 30 e.getY() - 10); try { // shake mouse so that first element is selected even in Java 1.6.0_11 Robot robot = new Robot(); robot.mouseMove(e.getX() + 1 e.getY()); robot.mouseMove(e.getX() e.getY()); } catch (AWTException ex) { ex.printStackTrace(); } } }); } public static void main(String[] args) { JFrame frame = new SelectedPopupMenu(); frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE); frame.setSize(800 600); frame.setVisible(true); } }  Nowadays the default behavior is to pop up the menu without any item selected. Actually I would argue that this is the correct behavior at least in Windows. Other non-Java applications do this too. I don't think it's worth breaking this convention even if there is only one item in the menu. If you feel otherwise you can set the selection index as in sean.bright's answer. So I finally got the chance to try it out on Java 1.6.0_11 and found some inconsistent behavior: If the popup menu juts out of the parent frame the item is automatically selected; if the popup menu appears entirely within the parent frame nothing is selected. Sounds like a Swing bug which at least warrants an RFE for consistent behavior. +1: The right behavior is whatever the particular platform does for other (non-Java) programs. Zach I agree with your general assessment but unfortunately this doesn't answer my question. I *want* to break away from the conventional behavior but I'm finding it impossible to do so. I'm trying to find out if this is a Swing bug or user error. I filed a bug report with Sun: http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6799989  MenuSelectionManager.defaultManager() is indeed a good solution but it won't work when you'll try to pre-select your JPopupMenu's sub menus (it will hide the parent menu). Also it messes up other keyboard navigation behaviors (you can't press left to hide the sub-menu etc.) Unfortunatelly there's no good solution for this question in Swing... My solution is ugly but sadly does the job perfect: public static void setMenuSelectedIndex(final JPopupMenu popupMenu final int index) { SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable(){public void run() { for (int i=0; i < index+1; i++) { popupMenu.dispatchEvent(new KeyEvent(popupMenu KeyEvent.KEY_PRESSED 0 0 KeyEvent.VK_DOWN '\0')); } }}); } As you can see I'm basically simulating 'Down' Keyboard Key-Presses on the popupmenu... A better solution might be not to Hardcodedly simulate VK_DOWN but to read the Popup's input map and determine which KeyCode means ""select next menu item"" - but I think most of us will get along with this hack... You might also want to look at this method which selects a menu's item once it gets selected It utilizes the previous method public static void setSelectedIndexWhenVisible(final JMenu menu final int index) { menu.getPopupMenu().addPopupMenuListener(new PopupMenuListener() { @Override public void popupMenuWillBecomeVisible(PopupMenuEvent e) { PopupUtils.setMenuSelectedIndex(menu.getPopupMenu() index); menu.getPopupMenu().removePopupMenuListener(this); } @Override public void popupMenuWillBecomeInvisible(PopupMenuEvent e) { } @Override public void popupMenuCanceled(PopupMenuEvent e) { } }); } aside from that the solution of simulating the down arrow keypress does work. er what's PopupUtils?

SQL does not support multiple assignment you need to do this procedurally. You need to use (at least) one INSERT statement per table. INSERT INTO users which auto-generates the UID value(s); Capture auto-generated value(s) for UID; INSERT INTO users supplying the captured UID value(s). FWIW SQL Server 2008 makes this easy with an OUTPUT keyword i.e. the auto-generated values can be captured (to a staging temp table) within the INSERT statement. In MS Access you could create a VIEW with a JOIN between the two tables then INSERT INTO the VIEW and the auto-generate value would appear automatically in both tables (only worked for a two-table VIEW). I don't know if mySQL has similar features. yup no INSERT CASCADE. just UPDATE CASCADE :| . ive just notice it .  The foreign key in your schema definition is the UID column in the Company table. This refers to a single row in the Users table. You can ensure that an invalid UID is never inserted into the Company table by adding a foreign key constraint... ALTER TABLE COMPANY ADD FOREIGN KEY COMPANY_USER_FK (UID) REFERENCES USER(UID); and this will cause attempts to add a UID into the Company name that don't exist in the User table to fail. You can add extra features so that deleting a User from the User table deletes all the matching rows in the Company table as follows... ALTER TABLE COMPANY ...etc... REFERENCES USER(UID) ON DELETE CASCADE; or you can prevent users from being deleted if rows for them exist in the company table by... ALTER TABLE COMPANY ...etc... REFERENCES USER(UID) ON DELETE RESTRICT; Although it doesn't apply to your schema you could also cascade changes to the UID in the Users table by... ALTER TABLE COMPANY ...etc... REFERENCES USER(UID) ON UPDATE CASCADE; Note that all of this only works on MySQL if the storage engine is INNODB; ALTER TABLE COMPANY ...etc... REFERENCES USER(UID) ON UPDATE CASCADE; this one. why it doent update? my company table is still empty when im inserting the users data. ooooooooooooooooooooooooo i see there is no INSERT CASCADE. akakakak . stupid me .",php sql mysql database database-design,1.1899660335058654E-4,1.9406128956620571E-4,0.9995379761280354,1.4896597904786563E-4
408820,"What is the difference between swing and awt? Can someone please explain me what's the difference between swing and awt? Are there any cases where awt is more useful/advised to use than swing or vice-versa? Related: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2994304/is-java-swing-still-in-use/2994324#2994324 Swing: Swing is part of the java foundation classes. Swing components are platform-independent. Swing components are lightweight components because swing sits on the top of awt. AWT: AWT is called the abstract window tool. AWT components are platform-dependent. AWT components are heavyweight components.  As far as when AWT may be more useful than Swing - you may be targeting an older JVM or platform that doesn't support Swing. This used to really come into play if you were building Applets - you wanted to target the lowest common denominator so people wouldn't have to install a newer Java plugin. I'm not sure what the current most widely installed version of the Java plugin is - this may be different today. some people prefer the native look of AWT over Swing's 'not quite there' platform skins. (There are better 3rd party native looking skins than Swing's implementations BTW) Lots of people preferred using AWT's FileDialog over Swing's FileChooser because it gave the platform file dialog most people were used to rather than the 'weird' custom Swing one. But for the last one we can also create a FileChooser that pretty much looks like windows file dialog (but with no autocomplete) http://stackoverflow.com/q/17630055/2534090  swing component provide much flexible user interface because it follow model view controller(mvc). awt is not mvc based. swing works faster. awt does not work faster. swing componets are light weight. awt componentsare heavy weight. swing occupies less memory space. awt occupies more memory space. swing component is platform independent. awt is platform dependent. swing require javax.swing package. awt require javax.awt package. I don't think swing works faster than AWT because AWT uses native code (the gui code) that was already there in the OS but swing builds every component from the scratch. So AWT might be faster. Could you say me what is your point of view in saying **swing works faster**? Thanks.  Several consequences result from this difference between AWT and Swing. AWT is a thin layer of code on top of the OS whereas Swing is much larger. Swing also has very much richer functionality. Using AWT you have to implement a lot of things yourself while Swing has them built in. For GUI-intensive work AWT feels very primitive to work with compared to Swing. Because Swing implements GUI functionality itself rather than relying on the host OS it can offer a richer environment on all platforms Java runs on. AWT is more limited in supplying the same functionality on all platforms because not all platforms implement the same-looking controls in the same ways. Swing components are called ""lightweight"" because they do not require a native OS object to implement their functionality. JDialog and JFrame are heavyweight because they do have a peer. So components like JButton JTextArea etc. are lightweight because they do not have an OS peer. A peer is a widget provided by the operating system such as a button object or an entry field object. Great answer. Especially the **peer** no one discussed this. Thank you :)  AWT is a Java interface to native system GUI code present in your OS. It will not work the same on every system although it tries. Swing is a more-or-less pure-Java GUI. It uses AWT to create an operating system window and then paints pictures of buttons labels text checkboxes etc. into that window and responds to all of your mouse-clicks key entries etc. deciding for itself what to do instead of letting the operating system handle it. Thus Swing is 100% portable and is the same across platforms (although it is skinnable and has a ""pluggable look and feel"" that can make it look more or less like how the native windows and widgets would look). These are vastly different approaches to GUI toolkits and have a lot of consequences. A full answer to your question would try to explore all of those. :) Here are a couple: AWT is a cross-platform interface so even though it uses the underlying OS or native GUI toolkit for its functionality it doesn't provide access to everything that those toolkits can do. Advanced or newer AWT widgets that might exist on one platform might not be supported on another. Features of widgets that aren't the same on every platform might not be supported or worse they might work differently on each platform. People used to invest lots of effort to get their AWT applications to work consistently across platforms - for instance they may try to make calls into native code from Java. Because AWT uses native GUI widgets your OS knows about them and handles putting them in front of each other etc. whereas Swing widgets are meaningless pixels within a window from your OS's point of view. Swing itself handles your widgets' layout and stacking. Mixing AWT and Swing is highly unsupported and can lead to ridiculous results such as native buttons that obscure everything else in the dialog box in which they reside because everything else was created with Swing. Because Swing tries to do everything possible in Java other than the very raw graphics routines provided by a native GUI window it used to incur quite a performance penalty compared to AWT. This made Swing unfortunately slow to catch on. However this has shrunk dramatically over the last several years due to more optimized JVMs faster machines and (I presume) optimization of the Swing internals. Today a Swing application can run fast enough to be serviceable or even zippy and almost indistinguishable from an application using native widgets. Some will say it took far too long to get to this point but most will say that it is well worth it. Finally you might also want to check out SWT (the GUI toolkit used for Eclipse and an alternative to both AWT and Swing) which is somewhat of a return to the AWT idea of accessing native Widgets through Java. :) .. please check my edited question Um... having done some pretty extensive Swing across multiple platforms I can tell you that it very much is not the same across platforms. Similar? Sure. Same? No way. thanks a lot skiphoppy... The heavyweight/leightweight problems will disappear with Java 6 update 12 (see http://java.dzone.com/news/a-farewell-heavyweightlightwei). Wow. I can't believe they can fix it and I still can't believe mixing lightweight and heavyweight components would ever be desirable. But it's incredible that they can fix it. Just forget about both. Have a look at WPF. :)  AWT 1 . AWT occupies more memory space 2 . AWT is platform dependent 3 . AWT require javax.awt package swings 1 . Swing occupies less memory space 2 . Swing component is platform independent 3 . Swing requires javax.swing package Could you say me how does AWT occupies more memory space? Because it uses native code? awt requires java.awt.*  Swing vs AWT. Basically AWT came first and is a set of heavyweight UI components (meaning they are wrappers for operating system objects) whereas Swing built on top of AWT with a richer set of lightweight components. Any serious Java UI work is done in Swing not AWT which was primarily used for applets. are there any cases where awt is more useful/ advised to use then swing? Samiksha make that another question instead of trying to have a discussion thread in these comments. :) It used to be relevant... 10 years ago. @Pacerier he was talking about AWT not SWT  The base difference that which already everyone mentioned is that One is heavy weight and other is light weight. Let me explain bacially what the term heavy weight means is that when you are using the awt components the native code used for getting the view component is generated by the Operating System thats why it the look and feel changes from OS to OS. Where as in swing components its the responsibility of JVM to generate the view for the components. Another statement which i saw is that swing is MVC based and awt is not. actually Swing uses a Model-Delegate approach which is derived from the MVC approach where in the View and Controller are combined for a Delegate structure +1 for more simpler explanation",java swing awt,0.02058163078229034,0.9791518874250631,1.4039800788184022E-4,1.260837847646582E-4

118370,"How do you use the ellipsis slicing syntax in Python? This came up in Hidden features of Python but I can't see good documentation or examples that explain how the feature works. You'd use it in your own class since no builtin class makes use of it. Numpy uses it as stated in the documentation. Some examples here. In your own class you'd use it like this: >>> class TestEllipsis(object): ... def __getitem__(self item): ... if item is Ellipsis: ... return ""Returning all items"" ... else: ... return ""return %r items"" % item ... >>> x = TestEllipsis() >>> print x[2] return 2 items >>> print x[...] Returning all items Of course there is the python documentation and language reference. But those aren't very helpful. looks quite broken since the ""propper"" way to say all items is >>> x[:] >>> x[: 1:2] @Ronny: The point was to demonstrate some custom usage of Ellipsis. so true that docs are utterly cryptic  The ellipsis is used to slice higher-dimensional data structures. It's designed to mean at this point insert as many full slices (:) to extend the multi-dimensional slice to all dimensions. Example: >>> from numpy import arange >>> a = arange(16).reshape(2222) Now you have a 4-dimensional matrix of order 2x2x2x2. To select all first elements in the 4th dimension you can use the ellipsis notation >>> a[... 0].flatten() array([ 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14]) which is equivalent to >>> a[:::0].flatten() array([ 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14]) In your own implementations you're free to ignore the contract mentioned above and use it for whatever you see fit. This was a great explanation and good examples. Thanks!  Python documentation aren't very clear about this but there is another use of ellipsis. It is used as a representation of infinite data structures in case of Python. This question discusses how and some actual applications. This doesn't actually use the Python ellipsis object; it just uses ... when representing infinite structures as strings.  This is another use for Ellipsis which has nothing to do with slices: I often use it in intra-thread communication with queues as a mark that signals ""Done""; it's there it's an object it's a singleton and its name means ""lack of"" and it's not the overused None (which could be put in a queue as part of normal data flow). YMMV. P.S: I don't mind downvotes when what I say in an answer is not useful in relation to the question; then I try to improve my answer. But I sure can't understand how one can downvote any of the answers in this question��� when the question is ���how do you use the Ellipsis in Python����_ It seems that people think that downvoting means ���I disagree�� or ���I don't like this��. Never thought of that nice idea! Mightn't it be clearer to just say: ""Done = object()"" somewhere and just use that? Not necessarily - it requires you to actually _say_ Done=object() somewhere. Sentinel values aren't necessarily a bad thing -- and using otherwise nearly-useless Python singletons as sentinels isn't so horrible IMO (Ellipsis and () are the ones I've used where None would be confusing). +1 to counter unexplained anonymous downvotes. Regarding Done = object() I think using Ellipsis is better especially if you're using it for communication with queues. If you go from intra-thread to intra-process communication id(Done) will not be the same in the other process and there is nothing to distinguish one object from another. The id of Ellipsis won't be the same either but at least the type will be the same - this is the point of a singleton.",python numpy subclass slicing ellipsis,3.6357135821737854E-4,0.288927591749017,0.007900005297991867,0.7028088315947739
977629,"OpenGL Rotation Matrices And ArcBall I have been tasked with creating a OpenGL scene implementing ideas such as simple movement and an Arcball interface. The problem I am having is dealing with the rotation matrix which NeHe's Arcball class (http://nehe.gamedev.net/data/lessons/lesson.asp?lesson=48) computes. What I have so far is a very simple solar system (just the earth moon and sun) which looks great. What I want is for the camera to follow whichever planet the user selects (by clicking on the one they want) and for them to be able to rotate around the planet at a fixed distance using mouse-drag (arcball). As I said at the beginning NeHe's class is generating a rotation matrix based on the mouse clicking and dragging. What I want to apply the matrix to is the camera position. However when I do that my camera just wobbles without ever rotating around the planet. So I am guessing that I am either missing some step or that I have a horrible understanding of what I am trying to do. Here is some code from my camera class to crunch on: // transform is the matrix from NeHe's arcball interface void camera::update(Matrix4fT transform) { glm::mat4 transform_m = glm::mat4(0.0f); // convert nehe's matrices to GLM matrix for(int i=0; i < 4; i++) for(int j=0; j < 4; j++) transform_m[i][j] = transform.M[i*4+j]; // apply matrix to the position glm::vec4 pos4 = glm::vec4(this->pos 1.0f); pos4 = transform_m * pos4; this->pos = glm::vec3(pos4); } void camera::apply(planet *target) { // called at the beginning of GLPaint gluLookAt(this->pos.xthis->pos.ythis->pos.z // cam->position target->pos.xtarget->pos.ytarget->pos.z // moving this->up.xthis->up.ythis->up.z); // (010) } Other than that NeHe's functions are called in the right places (during click and drag)... So really I have no idea where to go from here. I hope someone can help me with this and if you want to see the whole code base (its programmed in C++ and pushed into a QTPanel) just send me an email. Thanks Carl Sverre (carl at carlsverre dot com) What does the ""transform"" matrix at camera::update represent exactly? As far as I understand the transform matrix should represent the required rotation of a sphere according to the arcball class. Hence if the user clicks one point at xyz on the sphere and moves the mouse to x2y2z2 the matrix will represent the required rotation of the sphere to move xyz to x2y2z2. Hope that makes sense. Well maybe I am wrong but what I think that is happening to you is that you are rotating around the center of coordinates and not around the planet (that it's what you want to do). To correct that what you have to do is: Translate the point you want to rotate around (the center of the planet) to the center of coordinates applying a translation of the negation of its position Rotate as you are doing it Undo the translation previously done. The thing to understand is that rotations are done around the center of coordinates and if you want to rotate around somewhere different you must first move that point to the center of coordinates. Hope that it helps. Well I solved the problem but I went down a different path. I made sure that the sphere I was rotating about was at 000 and rather than rotating the camera I just rotated the scene. Anyways long story short its fixed. I will give this one to you because no one else answered and your answer helped me get to my solution. Cheers Hey thanks for the answer! I tried to implement what you mentioned like so: http://2dsquid.pastebin.com/m510b0130 Unfortunately it didn't work and results in my camera flying away from my planet until the whole scene is out of the frustrum. Maybe I have the order wrong in the multiplication... Any suggestions? So I figured out the zooming out problem (my rotation matrix was computed on a sphere around 000 so I was transforming 1 to many times)... Now the camera sorta rotates around the planet like it should except it rotates at light speed and if I rotate to the left for awhile and then try to rotate to the right it keeps rotating to the left until it seems to ""normalize"" and then start rotating to the right. And any up/down motion messes it all up. Any ideas? If it is rotating too fast you must configure your multiplication parameters to make it rotate slower..

99626,"What's the definitive Java Swing starter guide and reference? Obviously the Java API reference but what else is there that you all use? I've been doing web development my entire career. Lately I've been messing around a lot with Groovy and I've decided to do a small application in Griffon just to experiment more with Groovy and also break some ground in desktop development. The only thing is I'm totally green when it comes to desktop apps. So world where's a good place to start? The Swing Tutorial is very good. Apart from that the Swing API is obviously the reference however it's also a treasure trove of fairly good source code! Add the API source to your IDE and you can jump directly to the implementation to all the Swing classes. This is a great way to explore the functionality see how various Swing components work and learn a good Swing ""style"". Furthermore it's great to be able to step through the API classes if things don't seem to work and you have no idea why! Adding the API source to the IDE has the additional benefit that you get all the JavaDocs along with it although all modern IDEs can also pull them from the net -- you do not want to program desktop Java without the documentation available from within the IDE! NetBeans and other IDEs do make the creation of IDEs very easy but be aware that there is a lot more to Swing than just containers and layout managers. In fact containers and layout managers are among the easier things and I'd recommend learning to use them by hand too. There is nothing at all wrong with using a GUI builder but in some cases it's overkill and then it's nicer to just quickly whip up a GUI from source. In other cases you need to be able to create a GUI dynamically and then GUI builders are no use at all! For creating very complex layouts from source I recommend FormLayout which has its own set of quirks but which does scale (in terms of programming effort) to very big frames and layouts. If you've only done Groovy so far you'll be surprised how well documented Swing and the rest of the Java API is and how well everything is integrated. It might also take some getting used to a different style of programming using the debugger more often and println-debugging less etc. There might also be some ""boiler-plate"" code that will be very annoying. ;) Enjoy. I've actually been doing a lot of Java development but all with a web front end (mostly Struts) so I'm very familiar with debugging and the usefulness of IDEs. I guess I'm looking for more of a refcard type resource that I can use to help until I become more familiar with the components and widets  When it comes to developing java desktop applications I would highly recommend using the IDE environment Netbeans. Especially when it comes to the development of Swing based applications.  The Sun Java tutorials are pretty good. I cannot vouch specifically for the Swing one as it has been ages since I've done any Swing development and I have not read it myself. Creating a GUI with JFC/Swing  I recommend you to play around with netbeans. It will allow you to build complete GUIs using only your mouse. Once you get familiar with Swing components start using the Java API. Thats how I started.  The O'Reilly Swing Book is a pretty good reference it has a good overview of general Swing concepts and covers each of the major classes.

Can anyone give me some pointers of what elements I'll need and how I should go about learning to do this? with a ""#include"" perhaps? sorry couldn't help myself :) You can find implementation of FFT algorithms and other useful informations in Numerical Recipes in C book. The book is free AFAIK. There is also Numerical Recipes in C++ book.  For the music analysis part you should study the basis of Fourier series then pick a free implementation of a DFFT (digital fast fourier transform) algorithm.  From my point of view...check this site: http://nehe.gamedev.net/ really good Information and Tutorials for using OpenGL edit: http://www.opengl.org/code/  If you use C++/CLI here's an example that uses WPF four (fourier that is;) display. He references this site that has considerable information about what your asking here's anoutline from the specific page; How do we split sound into frequencies? Our ears do it by mechanical means mathematicians do it using Fourier transforms and computers do it using FFT. The Physics of Sound 1.2. Harmonic Oscillator Sampling Sounds Fourier Analysis Complex Numbers Digital Fourier Transform FFT Ahhh I found this a few minutes later it's a native C++ analyzer. Code included that should get you off and running.  My approach for creating BeatHarness (http://www.beatharness.com) : record audio in real time have a thread that runs an FFT on the audio to get the frequency intensities calculate audio-volume for left and right channel filter the frequencies in bands (bass midtones treble) now you have some nice variables to use in your graphics display. For example show a picture where the size is multiplied by the bass - this will give you a picture that'll zoom in on the beat. From there on it's your own imagination ! :)  Are you trying to write your own audio/music player? Perhaps you should try writing a plugin for an existing player so you can focus on graphics rather than the minutia of codecs dsp and audio output devices. I know WinAMP and Foobar have APIs for visualization plugins. I'm sure Windows Media Player and iTunes also have them. Just pick a media player and start reading. Some of them may even have existing OpenGL plugins from which you can start so you can focus on pure OpenGL. I'm not trying to write a player or anything just something that will take in an MP3 and visualize it but I don't know anything about how to connect all those pieces. I'm on Linux so I'd stick to something simple. Haven't really thought about integrating it into anything else. consider using a library like mpg123 libmad or ffmpeg to decode then mp3 into audio samples. From there you'll want to use DFT(FFT) to convert audio to frequency information (see FFTW). At this point you'll have raw frequency data similar to what you see on most visuliazers (winamp/xmms moving lines w/ peaks). After that you need to figure out what to visual based on frequency and changes in frequency.  If you're just after some basic 3D or accelerated 2D then I'd recommend purchasing a copy of Dave Astle's ""Beginning OpenGL Game Programming"" which covers the basics of OpenGL in C++.  You may want to consider using libvisual's FFT/DCT functions over FFTW; they're much simpler to work with and provide data that's similarly easy to work with for the sake of generating visuals. Several media players and visualization plugins use libvisual to some extent for their visuals.

340185,"using GDAL/OGR api to read vector data (shapefile)--How? I am working on an application that involves some gis stuff. There would be some .shp files to be read and plotted onto an opengl screen. The current opengl screen is using the orthographic projection as set from glOrtho() and is already displaying a map using coordinates from a simple text file.. Now the map to be plotted is to be read from a shapefile. I have the following doubts: How to use the WGS84 projection of the .shp file(as read from the .prj file of the shapefileWKT format) into my existing glOrtho projection..is there any conversion that needs to be done? and how is it different from what the glOrtho() sets up?basically how to use this information? My application needs to be setup in such a way that i can know the exact lat/long of a point on the map.for eg. if i am hovering on X cityits correct lat/long could be fetched.I know that this can be done by using opensource utils/apis like GDAL/OGR but i am messed up as the documentation of these apis are not getting into my head. I tried to find some sample c++ progs but couldnt find one. I have already written my own logic to read the coordinates from a shapefile containing either points/polyline/polygon(using C-shapelib) and plotted over my opengl screen.I found a OGR sample code in doc to read a POINTS shapefile but none for POLYGON shapefile.And the problem is that this application has to be so dynamic that upon loading the shapefileit should correctly setup the projection of the opengl screen depending upon the projection of the .shp file being read..eg WGS84LCCEVEREST MODIFIED...etc. how to achieve this from OGR api? Kindly give your inputs on this problem.. I am really keen to make this work but im not getting the right start.. 1.Shapefile rendering is quite straight forward in OpenGL.You may require ""shapelib""a free shapefile parsing library in C(google for it).Use GL_POINTS for point shapefile GL_LINES for line shapefile and GL_LINE_LOOP for polygon shapefile.Set your bounding box coods to the Ortho. 2.What u read from .prj file is projection info.WGS84 gives u lat/long coods(Spherical). But ur display system is 2D(Rectangular).Sou need to convert 3D Spherical coods to 2D Rectangular coods(This is the meaning of Projection).Projection types are numerousdepending on the area of interest on the globe(remeber projection distorts area/shape/size of features).Projection types range from PolyconicModified EverestNADUTM etc. 3.If u simly need WGS84 then read bounding box coods of ur sh file and assign them to glOrtho.If u have any projection(eg:-UTM) then u convert ur bounding box coods into Projection coods and then assign the newly projected coods to glOrtho.For converting lat/long into any Projectionu may require projection libraries like ""Projlib"" or ""GeotransEngine"" and etc. For further clarifications u may contact me on dgplinux@ y a h o o . c o m  Please read the OGR API Tutorial where you can learn how to read vector data from sources like Shapefile. Next check the OGR Projections Tutorial where you can learn about how to use information about projection and spatial reference system read from OGR sources.  GDAL/OGR has everything you need to load a vector file then convert any coordinates. I understand your frustration with GDAL as the documentation is not the greatest.

I can compete with experts despite no cartography training due to these guides. Another good source is Wikipedia. When in doubt just pick a UTM grid you want to stick with and use UTM as your coordinate system. It uses X (Easting) Y(Northing) and Z(Altitude). The only key is picking a single UTM Grid and making sure all coordinates use that as a reference. UTM is easy to test code with as there are a lot of guides online. You also can find conversion code using OGR/GDAL or other resources. Other projected coordinate systems are worthwhile and may be better but I would look at that to start with.

What is the best way to do this? Currently I redefine most of the functions from math in the module uncertainties.py so that they work on numbers with uncertainties. One drawback is that users who want to do from math import * must do so after doing import uncertainties. The interaction with NumPy is however restricted to basic operations (an array of numbers with uncertainties can be added etc.); it does not (yet) include more complex functions (e.g. sin()) that would work on NumPy arrays that contain numbers with uncertainties. The approach I have taken so far consists in suggesting that the user define sin = numpy.vectorize(math.sin) so that the new math.sin function (which works on numbers with uncertainties) is broadcast to the elements of any Numpy array. One drawback is that this has to be done for each function of interest by the user which is cumbersome. So what is the best way to extend mathematical functions such as sin() so that they work conveniently with simple numbers and NumPy arrays? The approach chosen by NumPy is to define its own numpy.sin rather than modifying math.sin so that it works with Numpy arrays. Should I do the same for my uncertainties.py module and stop redefining math.sin? Furthermore what would be the most efficient and correct way of defining sin so that it works both for simple numbers numbers with uncertainties and Numpy arrays? My redefined math.sin already handles simple numbers and numbers with uncertainties. However vectorizing it with numpy.vectorize is likely to be much slower on ""regular"" NumPy arrays than numpy.sin. It looks like following what NumPy itself does keeps things clean: ""extended"" mathematical operations (sin��_) that work on new objects can be put in a separate name space. Thus NumPy has numpy.sin etc. These operations are mostly compatible with those from math but also work on NumPy arrays. Therefore it seems to me that mathematical functions that should work on usual numbers and NumPy arrays and their counterparts with uncertainties are best defined in a separate name space.

How can I write a SQL query which involves database_1.table_1 and database_2.table_1 ? E.g. consider this query $sql = ""SELECT distinct database_1.users.id database_1.users.name FROM database_1.users database_2.sales WHERE database_2.sales.user_id = database_1.users.id""; How this query could be written using multiple db adapter? Edit: I thought of using 2 database adapters because this way I can change actual database names in application.ini. Is there any other way I can change database names without changing sql queries? Solution I'm using: I used another config variable to read second database name. First database name comes from adapter settings. You can't unless you use something like Federated databases but even then you'd use one database adapter for the query and let the database handle the fetching from the federated other databases. Zend_Application_Resource_Multidb is just setting up multiple database adapters at once. Nothing more. You will use each adapter separately from the other. Use Adapter1 to query database1 and use adapter to query database2. Two queries. Merge the results inside your application. @Gordon: That's what I suspected. @Gordon: could you please comment on my 'Edit in the question' above? @understack are these databases on the same server in the same database system? yes. BTW I ended up using the approach I mentioned in edit. I made another config variable to read second database name and it is working properly. @understack ah well you solved it yourself :) cheers",php sql database zend-framework,5.162370388459824E-4,8.418864291877033E-4,0.9979956248428664,6.462516890998617E-4
1949225,"""painting"" one array onto another using python / numpy I'm writing a library to process gaze tracking in Python and I'm rather new to the whole numpy / scipy world. Essentially I'm looking to take an array of (xy) values in time and ""paint"" some shape onto a canvas at those coordinates. For example the shape might be a blurred circle. The operation I have in mind is more or less identical to using the paintbrush tool in Photoshop. I've got an interative algorithm that trims my ""paintbrush"" to be within the bounds of my image and adds each point to an accumulator image but it's slow(!) and it seems like there's probably a fundamentally easier way to do this. Any pointers as to where to start looking? Sounds like you want some form of quick blit. However I lack knowledge of python to suggest a good answer. OpenCV uses numpy arrays and has basic drawing functions: circles elipses polylines... To draw a line you can call cv.line(arrayprevious_pointnew_pointcolourthickness=x) each time you get a mouse event.  Have you looked into Tkinter? Python Image Library may be some help too. Tkinter alarms me a bit -- I'm really leery of using a GUI tooklit to do array math. And I'm familiar with PIL but don't really see how this solves anything that numpy doesn't. I'd still need to do some odd jiggery-pokery to add the arrays together...?  In your question you describe a Gaussian filter for which scipy has support via a package. For example: from scipy import * # rand from pylab import * # figure imshow from scipy.ndimage import gaussian_filter # random ""image"" I = rand(100 100) figure(1) imshow(I) # gaussian filter J = gaussian_filter(I sigma=10) figure(2) imshow(J) Of course you can apply this on the whole image or just on a patch using slicing: J = array(I) # copy image J[30:70 30:70] = gaussian_filter(I[30:70 30:70] sigma=1) # apply filter to subregion figure(2) imshow(2) For basic image manipulation the Python Image library (PIL) is probably what you want. NOTE: for ""painting"" with a ""brush"" I think you could just create a boolean mask array with your brush. For instance: # 7x7 boolean mask with the ""brush"" (example: a _crude_ circle) mask = array([[0 0 1 1 1 0 0] [0 1 1 1 1 1 0] [1 1 1 1 1 1 1] [1 1 1 1 1 1 1] [1 1 1 1 1 1 1] [0 1 1 1 1 1 0] [0 0 1 1 1 0 0]] dtype=bool) # random image I = rand(100 100) # apply filter only on mask # compute the gauss. filter only on the 7x7 subregion not the whole image I[40:47 40:47][mask] = gaussian_filter(I[40:47 40:47][mask] sigma=1) Hm this may put me on the right track -- I think some slicing magic will help me do what I need. I added an example with a boolean mask maybe that's what you need. this is nice +1 :)  Doing a little of math in Fourier space may help: a translation (convolution by a dirac) is equal to a simple multiplication by a phase in Fourier... this makes your paintbrush move to the exact place (a similar solution than catchmeifyoutry & dwf but this allows a translation finer than the pixel like 2.5 alas with some ringing). Then a sum of such strokes is the sum of these operations. In code: import numpy import pylab from scipy import mgrid def FTfilter(image FTfilter): from scipy.fftpack import fftn fftshift ifftn ifftshift from scipy import real FTimage = fftshift(fftn(image)) * FTfilter return real(ifftn(ifftshift(FTimage))) def translate(image vec): """""" Translate image by vec (in pixels) """""" u = ((vec[0]+image.shape[0]/2) % image.shape[0]) - image.shape[0]/2 v = ((vec[1]+image.shape[1]/2) % image.shape[1]) - image.shape[1]/2 f_x f_y = mgrid[-1:1:1j*image.shape[0] -1:1:1j*image.shape[1]] trans = numpy.exp(-1j*numpy.pi*(u*f_x + v*f_y)) return FTfilter(image trans) def occlude(image mask): # combine in oclusive mode return numpy.max(numpy.dstack((image mask)) axis=2) if __name__ == '__main__': Image = numpy.random.rand(100 100) X Y = mgrid[-1:1:1j*Image.shape[0] -1:1:1j*Image.shape[1]] brush = X**2 + Y**2 < .05 # relative size of the brush # shows the brush pylab.imshow(brush) # move it to some other position / use a threshold to avoid ringing brushed = translate(brush [20 -10.51]) > .6 pylab.imshow(brushed) pylab.imshow(occlude(Image brushed)) more_strokes = [[40 -15.1] [-40 -15.1] [-25 15.1] [20 10] [0 -10] [25 -10.51]] for stroke in more_strokes: brushed = brushed + translate(brush stroke) > .6 pylab.imshow(occlude(Image brushed))  You should really look into Andrew Straw's motmot and libcamiface. He uses it for fly behaviour experiments but it's a flexible library for doing just the kind of image acquisition and processing you're doing I think. There's a video of his presentation at SciPy2009. As for the paintbrush scenario you mention I'd make a copy of the image with the .copy() method keep the paintbrush image in an array and simply add it with arr[first_br_row:last_br_row first_br_col:last_br_col] += brush[first_row:last_row first_col:last_col] where you set first_br_row last_br_row first_br_col last_br_col to address the subimage where you want to add the brush and first_row last_row first_col last_col to clip the brush (normally set them to 0 and # rows/cols - 1 but adjust when you're near enough to the image boundary to only want to paint part of the brush). Hope all that helps. Thanks! Turns out that yes slicing and indexing tricks will help a bunch. However! The Right Answer is probably to draw individual points and apply the brush and blur both as kernels.

188944,Java/Swing: How to draw a simple bar graph in a custom renderer for a JLabel I would like to dynamically create a minimal transparent bar graph to display over a canvas. I was thinking of using a custom renderer for a JButton or a JLabel; but how do I draw my bar graph in this renderer? The standard way would be to create a subclass (possibly an anonymous one if you prefer) of JLabel or JPanel and overload the paintComponent(Graphics g) method. You can then use the passed Graphics object to draw whatever rectangles (and so forth) that you need. For more information on that part of it refer to the Java 2D Graphics Trail. EDIT: Does that answer the question? I just re-read it and now I'm not sure. Your answer is OK... I was thinking of a custom renderer as for table cells but this may not exist for JLabel &/or JButtons. thanks julien Okay. And no there isn't a custom renderer for JLabel or JButton (at least not in standard Swing; there might be third-party libraries which offer something similar). To add any JComponent to a JTable you can extend the DefaultTableCellRenderer and over ride the getTableCellRendererComponent. Just return an instance of your BarGraph object. You have to set the cellRenderder on the JTable also to your subclassed DefaultTableCellRenderer.,java swing custom-renderer,6.805538985941739E-4,0.9698407939669431,0.028626700272439874,8.519518620228187E-4
294813,Embedding web browser window in Java Does anyone know a way to open up an instance of the platform's (Windows/Linux/Mac) browser within a Swing window that is integrated into a Java application. No other actions would be preformed other than opening a given URL. Currently we open a new browser window because the Java embedded browsers have been insufficient. However from a user interaction standpoint this is less than desirable. I'm curious if a solution for this was part of the 1.6 Java release. So far my google-foo has not turned up anything of note. Are there any closed-source libraries that do this? Anything? WebRenderer is a commercial product that does this and does it well.

1351129,Calculating 3D tangent space In order to use normal mapping in GLSL shaders you need to know the normal tangent and bitangent vectors of each vertex. RenderMonkey makes this easy by providing it's own predefined variables (rm_tangent and rm_binormal) for this. I am trying to add this functionality to my own 3d engine. Apparently it is possible to calculate the tangent and bi tangent of each vertex in a triangle using each vertex's xyz coordinates uv texture coordinates and normal vector. After some searching I devised this function to calculate the tangent and bitangent for each vertex in my triangle structure. void CalculateTangentSpace(void) { float x1 = m_vertices[1]->m_pos->Get(0) - m_vertices[0]->m_pos->Get(0); float x2 = m_vertices[2]->m_pos->Get(0) - m_vertices[0]->m_pos->Get(0); float y1 = m_vertices[1]->m_pos->Get(1) - m_vertices[0]->m_pos->Get(1); float y2 = m_vertices[2]->m_pos->Get(1) - m_vertices[0]->m_pos->Get(1); float z1 = m_vertices[1]->m_pos->Get(2) - m_vertices[0]->m_pos->Get(2); float z2 = m_vertices[2]->m_pos->Get(2) - m_vertices[0]->m_pos->Get(2); float u1 = m_vertices[1]->m_texCoords->Get(0) - m_vertices[0]->m_texCoords->Get(0); float u2 = m_vertices[2]->m_texCoords->Get(0) - m_vertices[0]->m_texCoords->Get(0); float v1 = m_vertices[1]->m_texCoords->Get(1) - m_vertices[0]->m_texCoords->Get(1); float v2 = m_vertices[2]->m_texCoords->Get(1) - m_vertices[0]->m_texCoords->Get(1); float r = 1.0f/(u1 * v2 - u2 * v1); Vec3<float> udir((v2 * x1 - v1 * x2) * r (v2 * y1 - v1 * y2) * r (v2 * z1 - v1 * z2) * r); Vec3<float> vdir((u1 * x2 - u2 * x1) * r (u1 * y2 - u2 * y1) * r (u1 * z2 - u2 * z1) * r); Vec3<float> tangent[3]; Vec3<float> tempNormal; tempNormal = *m_vertices[0]->m_normal; tangent[0]=(udir-tempNormal*(Vec3Dot(tempNormal udir))); m_vertices[0]->m_tangent=&(tangent[0].Normalize()); m_vertices[0]->m_bitangent=Vec3Cross(m_vertices[0]->m_normal m_vertices[0]->m_tangent); tempNormal = *m_vertices[1]->m_normal; tangent[1]=(udir-tempNormal*(Vec3Dot(tempNormal udir))); m_vertices[1]->m_tangent=&(tangent[1].Normalize()); m_vertices[1]->m_bitangent=Vec3Cross(m_vertices[1]->m_normal m_vertices[1]->m_tangent); tempNormal = *m_vertices[2]->m_normal; tangent[2]=(udir-tempNormal*(Vec3Dot(tempNormal udir))); m_vertices[2]->m_tangent=&(tangent[2].Normalize()); m_vertices[2]->m_bitangent=Vec3Cross(m_vertices[2]->m_normal m_vertices[2]->m_tangent); } When I use this function and send the calculated values to my shader the models look almost like they do in RenderMonkey but they flicker in a very strange way. I traced the problem to the tangent and bitangent I am sending OpenGL. This leads me to suspect that my code is doing something wrong. Can anyone see any problems or have any suggestions for other methods to try? I should also point out that the above code is very hacky and I have very little understanding of the math behind what is going on. Found the solution. Much simpler (but still a little hacky) code: void CalculateTangentSpace(void) { float x1 = m_vertices[1]->m_pos->Get(0) - m_vertices[0]->m_pos->Get(0); float y1 = m_vertices[1]->m_pos->Get(1) - m_vertices[0]->m_pos->Get(1); float z1 = m_vertices[1]->m_pos->Get(2) - m_vertices[0]->m_pos->Get(2); float u1 = m_vertices[1]->m_texCoords->Get(0) - m_vertices[0]->m_texCoords->Get(0); Vec3<float> tangent(x1/u1 y1/u1 z1/u1); tangent = tangent.Normalize(); m_vertices[0]->m_tangent = new Vec3<float>(tangent); m_vertices[1]->m_tangent = new Vec3<float>(tangent); m_vertices[2]->m_tangent = new Vec3<float>(tangent); m_vertices[0]->m_bitangent=new Vec3<float>(Vec3Cross(m_vertices[0]->m_normal m_vertices[0]->m_tangent)->Normalize()); m_vertices[1]->m_bitangent=new Vec3<float>(Vec3Cross(m_vertices[1]->m_normal m_vertices[1]->m_tangent)->Normalize()); m_vertices[2]->m_bitangent=new Vec3<float>(Vec3Cross(m_vertices[2]->m_normal m_vertices[2]->m_tangent)->Normalize()); } Sorry but that's just wrong. What you do is simply scale the edge v01 by 1/u1. Not only could u1 be zero but it obviously is not correct. For a correct answer refer to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5255806/how-to-calculate-tangent-and-binormal  You will get zero division in your 'r' calculation for certain values of u1 u2 v1 and v2 resulting in unknown behavior for 'r'. You should guard against this. Figure out what 'r' should be if the denominator is zero and that MIGHT fix your problem. I too have little understanding of the math behind this. Suggested implementation that sets r = 0 if denominator is zero: #include <cmath> ... static float PRECISION = 0.000001f; ... float denominator = (u1 * v2 - u2 * v1); float r = 0.f; if(fabs(denominator) > PRECISION) { r = 1.0f/denominator; } ...

318390,Running numpy from cygwin I am running a windows machine have installed Python 2.5. I also used the windows installer to install NumPy. This all works great when I run the Python (command line) tool that comes with Python. However if I run cygwin and then run Python from within it cannot find the numpy package. What environment variable do I need to set? What value should it be set to? Cygwin comes with its own version of Python so it's likely that you have two Python installs on your system; one that installed under Windows and one which came with Cygwin. To test this try opening a bash prompt in Cygwin and typing which python to see where the Python executable is located. If it says /cygdrive/c/Python25/python.exe or something similar then you'll know you're running the Windows executable. If you see /usr/local/bin/python or something like that then you'll know that you're running the Cygwin version. I recommend opening a DOS prompt and running Python from there when you need interactive usage. This will keep your two Python installs nicely separate (it can be very useful to have both; I do this on my own machine). Also you may have some problems running a program designed for Windows interactive console use from within a Cygwin shell. You were right! This was helpful. Thanks Note: numpy can be installed directly from the Cygwin setup.exe.  numpy built for windows is not compatible with cygwin python. You have to build it by yourself on cygwin.  You're running a separate copy of python provided by cygwin. You can run /cygdrive/c/python25/python (or wherever you installed it) to get your win32 one or just install another copy of numpy.  Ensure that PYTHONPATH has NumPy.

I've heard of ""multisampling"" but I don't need that. Edit: the nvidia control panel setting is ""application controlled"" when it doesn't work. do you create your render context with multisampling? that's what nvidia's control panel changes. It depends on your window system / framework usually there is a 'samples' value you can set to 4 or 8 somewhere. In windows it goes into the pixel format struct. Have you got the Antialiasing Settings"" in the nVidia control panel set to ""Application-Controlled""? Most likely your hardware does not support it. Not all OpenGL implementations support antialiased polygons; see the OpenGL FAQ. I've definitely run into this problem before on a first-generation MacBook -- its GPU the Intel GMA 950 does not support antialiased polygons. geforce 8800GTS should support though  It may be that your glEnable call is after the glHint call. nope i tried both ways. Interesting I'm unable to replicate what you're seeing with any of my code. I've got a hunch the NVidia Control Panel is not being your friend.

1626081,"OpenGL - Textures loading improperly UPDATE: I've posted the Renderer code below since this code here doesn't seem to be the problem. I'm having a problem with some code of mine where when I try to upload multiple textures to openGL one at a time it fails somewhat spectacularly with the renderer only ending up using a single texture. I've done a bit of debugging to trace the error to this function but I'm having problems figuring out what part of the function is at fault. Are there are particularly obvious screwups I'm making that I'm simply not seeing or is there a more subtle flaw in my code?

Basically it loads a named .png file out of a .zip archive using a prewritten library (incidentally it's being tested with this program).

Create a 4x4 texture and check the values to make sure you've got the right things out of the loader and that the byte ordering matches what you pass to glTexImage2D. Barring that I'd focus on your rendering code. Btw weird naming convention to start variable names with capital letter. I was confused for good 10 seconds when I first looked at your code. (not to say it's wrong just weird) I'm assuming you can't do any sort of debugging or logging for this? If you could I'd expect this would be trivial to diagnose. The main thing that looks dangerous to me is that you're not checking the return value from loadPNG. I'd put something there as the very first thing I did. I'd consider commenting out the initial check for an already-cached texture too. If things start working at that point you know it's a problem with the resource names or filenames (or the comparison of them). As an aside I'm surprised that you're using classes and smart pointers but rolling your own std::vector with bare pointers and arrays. ;) I have done debugging - and I've had no luck which is why I'm asking here. As far as the intermix goes well I'm sure I'll get around to making it make sense soon enough.  In your renderer are you calling glBindTexture appropriately? It sounds like your renderer is just using whatever the last texture you uploaded was since that was the last time you called glBindTexture. glBindTexture is what tells OpenGL texture to use for your polygons. Nope I'm making sure I always call glBindTexture() in the renderer. Would it help if I posted the relevant parts of it for reference? Yeah definitely since there is nothing obvious wrong in the loading code. (This assumes you are actually loading different textures of course. :) ) Print out the TextureNum before you call bind to be sure you are in fact at least setting a different opengl texture. Also try using GLintercept to see if you can spot anything using that. (I use this all the time to track down my opengl problems.) Running a debugger check on those shows that the sprite has TextureNum = 2 and level has TextureNum = 1. Thanks for the glIntercept tip though! ..And that solved my problem thanks! I should clarify; the GLIntercept program showed me what I did wrong. I had the last glEnd() one curly-brace too far down and wasn't noticing that.  With your rendering code I can see you're calling BindTexture in a glBegin/End block. From the opengl docs: GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if glBindTexture is executed between the execution of glBegin and the corresponding execution of glEnd. Move your BindTexture calls outside the glBegin()/glEnd() block and you should be golden. You'll probably have to have multiple blocks to accommodate your rendering style. edit: With the updated code make sure of a couple things; your sprite positions are visible on the screen with the current projection/model view matrix and your sprite texture ids are valid textures. There's nothing technically wrong that jumps out at me now but your values may be off. Hm now I'm getting the same issue but instead the *other* texture is used... Copying in the newer version knowing me I completely goofed it up... Make sure inside your render() calls you don't do anything wierd either. Remember there are a limited subset of functions you're permitted to call between glBegin and glEnd. The only things the sprite's render does is calculate some offsets and then call glTexCoord2f and glVertex3f.",c++ opengl textures,0.9984142877309403,1.0507261329323144E-4,8.98130458144248E-5,0.0013908266099519546

1735025,"How to normalize a NumPy array to within a certain range? After doing some processing on an audio or image array it needs to be normalized within a range before it can be written back to a file. This can be done like so: # Normalize audio channels to between -1.0 and +1.0 audio[:0] = audio[:0]/abs(audio[:0]).max() audio[:1] = audio[:1]/abs(audio[:1]).max() # Normalize image to between 0 and 255 image = image/(image.max()/255.0) Is there a less verbose convenience function way to do this? matplotlib.colors.Normalize() doesn't seem to be related. You can also rescale using sklearn. The advantages are that you can adjust normalize the standard deviation in addition to mean-centering the data and that you can do this on either axis by features or by records. from sklearn.preprocessing import scale X = scale( X axis=0 with_mean=True with_std=True copy=True ) The keyword arguments axis with_mean with_std are self explanatory and are shown in their default state. The argument copy performs the operation in-place if it is set to False. Documentation here.  You can use the ""i"" (as in idiv imul..) version and it doesn't look half bad: image /= (image.max()/255.0) For the other case you can write a function to normalize an n-dimensional array by colums: def normalize_columns(arr): rows cols = arr.shape for col in xrange(cols): arr[:col] /= abs(arr[:col]).max() Can you clarify this? The parentheses make it behave differently than without? @endolith: I think I was first but that doesn't matter. Accept the answer you like the most. parantheses don't change anything. the point was to use `/=` instead of `= .. / .. ` Oh you just both answered with the same thing at the same time?  audio /= np.max(np.abs(audio)axis=0) image *= (255.0/image.max()) Using /= and *= allows you to eliminate an intermediate temporary array thus saving some memory. Multiplication is less expensive than division so image *= 255.0/image.max() # Uses 1 division and image.size multiplications is marginally faster than image /= image.max()/255.0 # Uses 1+image.size divisions Since we are using basic numpy methods here I think this is about as efficient a solution in numpy as can be. Why is multiplication less expensive than division? I don't know exactly why. However I am confident of the claim having checked it with timeit. With multiplication you can work with one digit at a time. With division especially with large divisors you have to work with many digits and ""guess"" how many times the divisor goes into the dividend. You end up doing many multiplication problems to solve one division problem. The computer algorithm for doing division may not be the same as human long division but nevertheless I believe it's more complicated than multiplication. Probably worth mentioning a divide by zero for blank images.",python arrays numpy scipy convenience-methods,3.01216647602326E-4,4.912282319546443E-4,0.006545106092980403,0.9926624490274626
1147249,Connecting Catmull-Rom splines together and calculating its length? I'm trying to create a class which takes in any number of points (position and control) and creates a catmull-rom spline based on the information given. What I'm doing - and I'm really unsure if this is the right way to do it - is storing each individual point in a class like so: class Point { public: Vector3 position; Vector3 control; } Where obviously position is the position of the point and control is the control point. My issue is connecting up the splines - obviously given the above class holding a point in the spline array indicates that any given position can only have one control point. So when having three or more points in a catmull rom spline the various individual catmull-rom splines which are being connected share one position and one control with another such spline. Now with position being the same is required - since I want to create splines which are continuous between themselves. However I really wonder should the control points also be the same between the two splines? With a bit of fiddling of the control points I can make it appear to be transitioning smoothly from one spline to another however I must emphasize that I'm not sure if the way they are transitioning is consistent with how catmull-rom splines form their shape. I'd much rather do it correctly than sit on my hands and rationalize that it's good enough. Obviously the second part of my question is self explanatory: Given two control and position points how do I calculate the length of a catmull-rom spline? With regards to measuring the lengths you can do this with calculus since its a polynomial spline. You need to do integrate the distance function across the line. Its described quite well on Wikipedia...  To define the spline between two control points the Catmull-Rom spline needs the control points and the tangent vector at each control point. However the tangent vector at internal (i.e. non-endpoint) control points is defined by the control points on either side of it: T(Pn) = (Pn+1 - Pn-1) / 2. For closed curves the spline is completely defined by the set of control points. For non-closed curves you need to also supply the tangent vector at the first and last control point. This is commonly done: T(P0) = P1 - P0 and T(Pn) = Pn - Pn-1. Thus for closed curves your data structure is just a list of control points. For general splines it's a list of points plus the first and last normal vector. If you want to have a cardinal spline then you can add a weighting factor to the tangent vector calculation as in the Wikipedia article. To calculate the length of such a spline one approach would be to approximate it by evaluating the spline at many points and then calculating the linear distance between each neighboring pair of points.,c++ opengl graphics directx spline,0.06824128428231191,5.446010359961976E-4,4.655092917505321E-4,0.9307486053899413

What I would like to do is display an image straight onto the screen and I am not sure the easiest way to do that. My only idea is to draw a rectangle right in front of the screen and use the image as the texture. It seems like there should be an easier way. This is for menu screens and things so if there is a better way to do that as well please let me know. I would recommend setting up OpenGL for 2D rendering via gluOrtho2d(); then load the image into a texture and as you said draw it to the screen by creating a polygon and binding the texture to it. A good example can be found here.  You've got the basic idea. The other obvious alternative is to use glDrawPixels() but I think you'll find the texture method has much better performance.

You should just list all messages retrieved and deduce what message it is and why it appears. Using spy i got a hard flow of WM_PAINT with hdc 0. No idea how this is being generated. In your case the message queue must never be empty - why? Well it depends on what the rest of your program is doing. Some possibilities: Your code is posting new messages to the queue in a manner such that the queue doesn't get empty. I'd suggest logging out the message ids as they are handled. You aren't handling paint messages - from msdn: ""The PeekMessage function normally does not remove WM_PAINT messages from the queue. WM_PAINT messages remain in the queue until they are processed. However if a WM_PAINT message has a NULL update region PeekMessage does remove it from the queue."" Hope this helps. [Edit] To handle WM_PAINT either call BeginPaint and EndPaint or forward to DefWindowProc looks like you can also do it by forwarding wm_paint to DefWindowProc but it probably does the same thing looks like thats the problem. But the my MainWndProc is returning 0 from WM_PAINT. What I know is that every message you treat you return 0. So in theory no message should be left. He's handling WM_PAINT because he's seeing things appearing. Added this code and it start to work as expected. But would like to have some explanation if possible please. case WM_PAINT: BeginPaint(hwnd &ps); EndPaint(hwnd &ps); return 0; WM_PAINT isn't a real message - it's just a flag on the window that says it has invalidated regions (WM_PAINT never handled.) As long as that flag is present WM_PAINT will be generated. there isnt another way to acomplish that? looks like this will just add more processing to my program instead if just discard the message.  PeekMessage will return 0 only if there are no messages in the message queue. Since there are messages to be dispatched in the message queue it is returning a non-zero value and your else condition is never executed. I guess he is asking about this - why doesn't it ever happen that there're no messages left.  Make sure you are processing the WM_PAINT correctly. By this I mean make sure you are calling BeginPaint and EndPaint from inside the WM_PAINT message otherwise you will be confusing Windows into thinking your application still needs to be painted.

UPDATE: I am more interested in the technical and business impacts of Swing vs Qt than the license type/fee since in my case the cost is not a concern. I agree with Jason. This issue is quite subjective. I accepted an answer favoring Qt but I personally still favor Swing. @HaveAGuess: because at the time the question was posed Qt was a rising star. There are plenty of questions discussing other frameworks. This question focuses solely on the differences between Swing and Qt. Can I ask why we are disregarding Netbeans/Eclipse RCP and even Gtk?

Next discussing programming models signal-slot model has been presented as superiour to MVC with only measurement being number of the lines of the code required to achieve same effect! What was overlooked in that document is that Java's code is clearly self-documenting unlike Qt's. I'm not saying that Qt is worse than Swing. I'm just saying that that document should NOT be used as an argument. First two answers give the best description of both frameworks discussing it's strenghts and weakness alone without comparing programming models and pulling conlusions out of a thin air.  Qt is far better than AWT/Swing. I have been using Qt for past three years and have found absolutely no issues in application development.

You may get a lot of Java/Swing resources easily they are hundred a penny but if you can hire a good Qt/C++ application developer thats the best choice I say. No offence to Java developers but you have to accept the facts. Qt is available with LGPL licensing. I did not see anybody mention about its cross platform support and the way it is implemented. There is tremendous advantage for Qt there. Great documentation Qt's own intuitive IDE(QtCreator) lotsa examples and a great and fast growing community out there for support! Regarding shipping extra files - there are packaging solutions available. Read more here link text Questionable. How is Qt more cross-platform than Swing? How is LGPL better than ""GPL with classpath exception"" which Swing ships with?

I don't think finding experienced developer in Qt should be a showstopper : it is very easy and fast to learn Qt. The documentation is very good (that's maybe the best part of Qt : its documentation). IMHO the Qt community is great and I always found the help needed when I had problems. There is many forums (QtCenter.org QtForum.org and others) and Trolltech is running a very active mailing list. I didn't say that it is a showstopper. I just made a point to consider. As the original question mentioned it clearly. Would you down-vote the question too. Kidding. I didn't made any point regarding documentation. Its great I must admit. But I forgot to include it and now I did. By not so strong community I meant number of developers strength. Just go to any Java forum Suns JavaRanch Stackoverflow you would find much help. Of course your list is specific to Qt where else you will find help then if not there.  To correct Adeel's comments; You can ship your software commercially - you just have to include the source. There are thousands of developers with Qt experience (KDE). Qt is standard (used by KDE Nasa ESA Adobe Skype etc) There's a large Qt community and many books and the Qt Jambi product is quite new so it's not surprising it's not that well known yet. And thats what we are talking about Qt Jambi not Qt. I admit Qt is quite common even I am using KDE and quite a no. of applications built on top of Qt. By Commercially I meant closed source. I said it wrong sorry for that. Now correction is made.  Pete's comment is right on. For those who need a more powerful swing based toolkit check out Jide http://www.jidesoft.com/.  Be aware that Qt Jambi will be discontinued shortly. http://www.qtsoftware.com/about/news/preview-of-final-qt-jambi-release-available. My interpretation of this is that following the March 4.5 release Jambi will be in the same boat as Qt bindings for other languages - up to the community to maintain. Regarding your questions I have a few years of Swing experience and I've been working with Qt Jambi for the past month and I'm pretty mixed. On one hand I'm particularly disappointed with Qt's model/view paradigm. Creating an editable tree in Swing by contrast using a completely non-Swing model is a breeze. A couple of hours work. After a week of struggling I've come to the conclusion that it's just not possible to do such a thing in Jambi 4.4. (Dunno about 4.5) The only solution I can find in Qt is to tie data to the Qt model classes by subclassing QStandardItemModel and QStandardItem. (While QAbstractItemModel is very capable in C++ Qt it's literally unusable in Qt Jambi.) On the other hand Qt Jambi gives me access to the amazing QGraphicsView drawing tools and I don't know of a Java library that can compare. To me that's the power of Qt Jambi - it gives you access in Java to excellent 2D and GL drawing tools that really aren't available in Java otherwise. My advice is that if you need to build an application that uses only standard UI widgets like tables trees menus etc. then just use Swing. Layout in Swing is not that hard really especially with tools like NetBeans. However if you need GL or a canvas to paint on Qt Jambi might be worth looking into.  I think the most important factor you should consider is that Jambi QT is going to be discontinued from active development. Swing isn't that of a recent product as well. You should also definitely consider SWT since in my opinion it generally looks better than Swing. There are not production quality designers for SWT Eclipse comes built in with Windows Builder Pro now (or actually at the time of writing an available download that was suppose to be included into the Indigo release).  From my experience (one year Qt several years of Swing). Swing: Pro: Available on any Java installation. No need to ship any additional code You can write your own custom widgets in Java Contra: Swing is old. There haven't been any updates on the core for years and there won't ever be. If you plan to use Swing get a good wrapper which will make using Swing much more simple. Swing is hard to understand and use especially if you're used to UI programming on Windows. (One word: Layouts). Not many powerful widgets in the core set. You'll especially miss a good data grid. For a good look&feel you need an extra library Qt: Pro: Comprehensive set of powerful widgets Easy to use and learn Good documentation Good support Active development Uses native widgets and wraps them in a common API across all platforms Contra: You need to ship extra files Qt is written in C++ so you're accessing it via a wrapper library. If you need to implement a complex custom component things can get hairy. If you can hire a seasoned Swing developer give it a try. If you can't and if you have to start from scratch I suggest against Swing. With Qt you'll have results within hours and with only little hair pulling. Swing is powerful but it makes no attempt to hide this fact. So you'll find yourself struggling a lot with the API and the defaults which have made sense in 1996 but not anymore today. Qt has a much steeper learning curve and the API is much more consistent not to mention that Qt has been improved the last seven years while Swing hasn't (see below). KDE is based on Qt so there are lot of people out there using it and most of them have only little time (say a few hours here and there) and most can handle Qt after a short time. Which you simply can't say for Swing. There is a lot of Swing documentation but most only covers the common cases which you can figure out yourself from the Javadoc. If you need something more complex and if you're looking for a bird's eye view something which gives you a feeling how to combine things to achieve the desired result I haven't seen anything free and I also can't recommend a book for Swing book because I have stopped looking at them five years ago. If you look at Java 7 then you'll find that Sun is thinking about working on the Swing API. But: Java 7 is due in two years there is no commitment for this work items and last but not least: Can you switch to Java 7 when it will be available? Update: It seems that there won't be any Swing updates for Java 7 after all. Which is a pity. It will leave us with a built-in UI framework from the late 90's which just isn't on top of the times anymore. Being an old Amiga lover I know how it feels to be abandoned. Thanks Swing it's been a nice time. yeah because playing with AWT to generate a custom swing component is not a pain. Do you think in Swing we don't have good documentation good support. Come on I can come up with 10 or more times more article tutorials and books. Your pro and con stuff is just plain wrong. Swing has a lot more documentation tutorials and other resources available than there will ever be for QT. Swing is a very flexible framework which allows you to do whatever you want granted that makes it sometimes a bit complicated. At least it is free. I strictly disagree with your pros and cons. Completely disagree with all of your Swing cons. If you want to list pros and cons you must draw a line somewhere. Yeah there is a lot of Swing docs. They explain the basic stuff pretty well and then the air gets thin quick. So the Qt docs are better. Swing is flexible but it is also old. That's why I said it's more simple to write custom widgets in Swing *in Java* but Qt is easier to use and understand. From my experience Swing was good seven years ago and it stayed that way while everything else improved. It's sad :( Adeel: Ok I call. give me the URL of a good documentation of JTextPane which explains how to build your own custom editor with syntax hl spell checking everything you expect from an editor today. Dan: Since you give no reasons I can only ignore your comment :) Completely disagree with the entire answer quite frankly. Details in my answer below. It should also be pointed out that Swing widgets are non-native and ass ugly while Qt widgets are native and beautiful. Qt for Java i.e. Jambi will be officially abandoned as announced by Nokia. @Xolve: Last I heard is that Jambi > 4.5 will become OSS (just like Qt). Please either post a link if you have new information or stop spreading FUD. @Monkey: Please read the question again. This is not an argument against Swing it's whether he'll likely find developers. Qt is easier to learn than Swing. Plus Swing has been abandoned by Sun so no updates for Java 7 :( Gili: URL? As I heard it the Swing JSR will be part of the OpenJDK; that doesn't mean it will be in Java 7 :( FYI: Sun just announced that Swing Application Framework will be part of Java 7. To be completely clear Aaron's update about Swing updates not being issued past Java 7 is purely simply wrong. The Swing Application Framework (JSR 296) was (IMO) a relatively unambitious compromise effort to provide a unified foundation for building GUI apps but it only addressed the least interesting plumbing and infrastructure bits (e.g. resource mgmt bootstrapping session state etc). These are all capabilities that every Java app framework (including NetBeans and Eclipse) have done well for *years* so it's absolutely no loss (again IMO) that JSR 296 has been shelved. @Chas Emerick: I'm sure most readers will understand that my complaint is that Sun didn't put any effort into Swing for years not even something as JSR 296. I didn't say anything about JSR 296 itself. Qt widgets are _not_ native. It draws them itself just as Swing with native L&F does. It's just that Qt native L&F is somewhat better than Swing. Qt has themes that use native widget drawing mechanisms even if it does everything else itself so you can get a native ""look"" even if the ""feel"" is implemented in Qt. Aaron care to comment on this now one year later and with the changes in QT? Please include a @yar in your answer as I THINK that SO will inform me that way. Thanks! @yar: Well ... in one sentence: Swing still sucks a lot C++ Qt sucks a bit less than last year Java Qt sucks much more. I haven't used Qt Jambi for anything serious last year so I can't comment on its state but at least there is an open repository with the code and TrollTech tries to build a community to support it which is more than Sun does for Swing. Interesting. I got burned answering a few questions SO recently because I said that Swing does NOT give you native look and feel. People said ""get with it! That's no longer true! Swing is now near perfect."" I don't know myself... QT does NOT look like it's got much of a community behind it judging from random googling. So uh if Swing goes away what else can we use that's ""native""? Java would be left with no UI? Would we be stuck with either doing command line or web pages? @Brian: My experience is that Qt is much more simple to learn and use then Swing. This doesn't mean you *must not use Swing*. That would be silly. If you have a choice by all means use Qt. If you *don't* have a choice (because Qt just isn't available) well there is no point in arguing which is better is there? @Aaron Qt is fine except that it's not native. You have to go out of your way to use it. It adds complexity to the project and I don't even know if it's readily available in a stable version on all the platforms that Swing is. That's my concern right there. Qt is the basis for the Unix GUI environment KDE. Millions of lines of example code. And in my time maybe 10 years ago very well and extensively documented in the standard documentation. And the Qt philosophy matches QUI development very well which makes it easy to learn. ""If you plan to use Swing get a good wrapper which will make using Swing much more simple."" Which wrappers would you suggest? I've removed the part about Qt not being free for commercial apps. Qt is LGPL'd now. @Alexey: Try Swingx http://swingx.java.net/ +1 for the Amiga lover. I have FIVE. ;-)  I completely disagree with Aaron Digulla's entire answer as it pertains to Swing. I have found Swing to be while not the best design and a little convoluted reasonably simple and workable and ultimately quite well thought out. Further it most definitely is capable of what is required for almost all GUI app's. Using the native LAF the application will look and function enough like a native application to receive a passing grade (IMO). As to the bit about layouts... it's true that the Swing layout's are a little hard to use and need nesting (sometimes a fair amount thereof) to get the desired results but the concept of Layouts are one of the best things about doing GUI's in Java. Take the time to understand what they do for you and get yourself a good table-based layout (e.g. MatrixLayout TableLayout JGoodies FormLayout or MigLayout) which will eliminate 99% of the nesting. A table-based layout will also make your GUI simpler and will make the code better reflect the end visual result. So my advice is that if QT does things in a way in which you would prefer or provides functionality that Swing doesn't then by all means look into it - provided that you are happy with distributing it's Java and native components with your app and that it targets the platforms on which you want to run (or may want to run in the future). Otherwise it's hard to beat Swing's flexibility the fact that it's baked into every Java install and it's ability for you to easily tailor look and behavior. Oh and to be fair I have not looked at QT before - But I have about 6 10 years of active Swing and AWT development comprising 1 commercially deployed AWT application and 3 such (non-trivial) Swing applications plus a number of personal Swing apps. Perhaps more important is that I have implemented a fully-functional lightweight GUI toolkit on top of AWT very much analogous to Swing but with a completely different component and event architecture which has been successfully deployed commercially. Give a try to Qt ;) @Massimo: Last time I check QT for Java was abandoned or discontinued. You should give a try to C++ Qt Dude half year of Qt and 2 years of Swing and AWT here and if you say such things about Swing than you should definitely try Qt...",java qt gui swing,5.505284403153913E-5,0.9628559346491259,0.037020094566501245,6.891794034125471E-5
156472,Is there a good drop-in replacement for Java's JEditorPane? I'm not happy with the rendering of HTML by Swing's JEditorPane. In particular bullets for unordered lists are hideous. Customising the rendering seems extremely difficult. Therefore I'm looking for a replacement with better HTML rendering. Does this exist? (I asked Google and found nothing except a promising dead link). Something that I looked at extensively a while back - and there are many options - however I nearly ended up using http://lobobrowser.org/cobra.jsp but then the project was cancelled so I can't tell you how it all turned out... Cobra works well for my needs. I wish the jar was a little smaller though.  Cobra did the trick. Almost a drop-in replacement for JEditorPane with very nice HTML rendering. One complaint: it's a big jar to add to my little application. Thanks for the responses.  http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2004/05/24/html-pt1.html  Take a look at SwingBox. SwingBox is a Java Swing component that allows displaying the (X)HTML documents including the CSS support. It is designed as a JEditorPane replacement with considerably better rendering results.

1672926,"Setting up a camera in OpenGL I've been working on a game engine for awhile. I've started out with 2D Graphics with just SDL but I've slowly been moving towards 3D capabilities by using OpenGL. Most of the documentation I've seen about ""how to get things done"" use GLUT which I am not using. The question is how do I create a ""camera"" in OpenGL that I could move around a 3D environment and properly display 3D models as well as sprites (for example a sprite that has a fixed position and rotation). What functions should I be concerned with in order to setup a camera in OpenGL camera and in what order should they be called in? Here is some background information leading up to why I want an actual camera. To draw a simple sprite I create a GL texture from an SDL surface and I draw it onto the screen at the coordinates of (SpriteX-CameraX) and (SpriteY-CameraY). This works fine but when moving towards actual 3D models it doesn't work quite right. The cameras location is a custom vector class (i.e. not using the standard libraries for it) with X Y Z integer components. I have a 3D cube made up of triangles and by itself I can draw it and rotate it and I can actually move the cube around (although in an awkward way) by passing in the camera location when I draw the model and using that components of the location vector to calculate the models position. Problems become evident with this approach when I go to rotate the model though. The origin of the model isn't the model itself but seems to be the origin of the screen. Some googling tells me I need to save the location of the model rotate it about the origin then restore the model to its origal location. Instead of passing in the location of my camera and calculating where things should be being drawn in the Viewport by calculating new vertices I figured I would create an OpenGL ""camera"" to do this for me so all I would need to do is pass in the coordinates of my Camera object into the OpenGL camera and it would translate the view automatically. This tasks seems to be extremely easy if you use GLUT but I'm not sure how to set up a camera using just OpenGL. EDIT #1 (after some comments): Following some suggestion here is the update method that gets called throughout my program. Its been updated to create perspective and view matrices. All drawing happens before this is called. And a similar set of methods is executed when OpenGL executes (minus the buffer swap). The xyz coordinates are straight an instance of Camera and its location vector. If the camera was at (256 32 0) then 256 32 and 0 would be passed into the Update method. Currently z is set to 0 as there is no way to change that value at the moment. The 3D model being drawn is a set of vertices/triangles + normals at location X=320 Y=240 Z=-128. When the program is run this is what is drawn in FILL mode and then in LINE mode and another one in FILL after movement when I move the camera a little bit to the right. It likes like may Normals may be the cause but I think it has moreso to do with me missing something extremely important or not completely understanding what the NEAR and FAR parameters for glFrustum actually do. Before I implemented these changes I was using glOrtho and the cube rendered correctly. Now if I switch back to glOrtho one face renders (Green) and the rotation is quite weird - probably due to the translation. The cube has 6 different colors one for each side. Red Blue Green Cyan White and Purple. int VideoWindow::Update(double x double y double z) { glMatrixMode( GL_PROJECTION ); glLoadIdentity(); glFrustum(0.0f GetWidth() GetHeight() 0.0f 32.0f 192.0f); glMatrixMode( GL_MODELVIEW ); SDL_GL_SwapBuffers(); glLoadIdentity(); glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT); glRotatef(0 1.0f 0.0f 0.0f); glRotatef(0 0.0f 1.0f 0.0f); glRotatef(0 0.0f 0.0f 1.0f); glTranslated(-x -y 0); return 0; } EDIT FINAL: The problem turned out to be an issue with the Near and Far arguments of glFrustum and the Z value of glTranslated. While change the values has fixed it I'll probably have to learn more about the relationship between the two functions. If you have not checked then may be looking at following project would explain in detail what ""tsalter"" wrote in his post. Camera from OGL SDK (CodeColony) Also look at Red book for explanation on viewing and how does model-view and projection matrix will help you create camera. It starts with good comparison between actual camera and what corresponds to OpenGL API. Chapter 3 - Viewing  You have to do it using the matrix stack as for object hierarchy but the camera is inside the hierarchy so you have to put the inverse transform on the stack before drawing the objects as openGL only uses the matrix from 3D to camera.  Just remember that OpenGl post multiplies.  You need a view matrix and a projection matrix. You can do it one of two ways: Load the matrix yourself using glMatrixMode() and glLoadMatrixf() after you use your own library to calculate the matrices. Use combinations of glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW) and glTranslate() / glRotate() to create your view matrix and glMatrixMode(GL_PROJECTION) with glFrustum() to create your projection matrix. Remember - your view matrix is the negative translation of your camera's position (As it's where you should move the world to relative to the camera origin) as well as any rotations applied (pitch/yaw). Hope this helps if I had more time I'd write you a proper example! Thanks for the push in the right direction. I've made an edit in the post if you could take a look at my code and screenshots. Something is not quite right :) Actually the issue really is with the values I pick for the Near and Far arguments to glFrustum as well as the Z value passed into glTranslated.

1870997,Is it a good practice to write subqueries in MySQL? I am writing the following sub query for some project specific purpose: SELECT count(*) from table1 WHERE userB='$p' AND userA IN (SELECT userB FROM table1 WHERE userA='$row[username]') I was curious if this was the best practice when doing it in PHP or should I resort to the conventional way of first getting the subquery result and then counting the records? In general most databases perform better with left joins (which your query could be converted to) than subqueries. Joins in general but there are caveats  Worth noting that subqueries are only available in MySql 4.1 and higher. While ideally everyone should be on MySql 5 some users are stuck with what their host offers (I have been stung by this a few times).  I agree with Ted left join will be faster. and its easier to read too. also dont use count(*) use count(id)  As long as the subquery doesn't cause a performance hit I think it's better to stick to one query. It will minimize the code you have to write and maintain which is almost always a good thing.  I was curious if this was the best practice when doing it in PHP or should I resort to the conventional way of first getting the subquery result and then counting the records? Leaving the SQL query in PHP or stored procedure holy war aside less trips to the database is the best practice. There's time to the database & back that can never be recouped and separating the queries runs the risk of data changing in between the queries. Can the query itself be optimized? In this example potentially yes: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM TABLE t JOIN TABLE t2 ON t2.userB = t.userA AND t2.userA = '$row[username]' WHERE t.userB = '$p' If you really want to be sure about query performance you'll have to get familiar with generating an explain plan & interpreting the output to tune the query. What's an Explain Plan? The MySQL explain plan shows how the MySQL query optimizer has decided to run a SELECT statement in order to best access the data that's been requested. How Do I Generate an Explain Plan? In MySQL you just have to add the keyword explain to the SELECT query before the SELECT keyword. IE: EXPLAIN SELECT COUNT(*) FROM TABLE t JOIN TABLE t2 ON t2.userB = t.userA AND t2.userA = '$row[username]' WHERE t.userB = '$p' Probably should have mentioned this earlier but you don't want to run this from within PHP because it won't return what you queried for. Use whatever SQL IDE like PHPMyAdmin/etc. I've Gots My Explain Plan But What Does it Mean?!

911871,"Detect if a NumPy array contains at least one non-numeric value? I need to write a function which will detect if the input contains at least one value which is non-numeric. If a non-numeric value is found I will raise an error (because the calculation should only return a numeric value). The number of dimensions of the input array is not known in advance - the function should give the correct value regardless of ndim. As an extra complication the input could be a single float or numpy.float64 or even something oddball like a zero-dimensional array. The obvious way to solve this is to write a recursive function which iterates over every iterable object in the array until it finds a non-iterabe. It will apply the numpy.isnan() function over every non-iterable object. If at least one non-numeric value is found then the function will return False immediately. Otherwise if all the values in the iterable are numeric it will eventually return True. That works just fine but it's pretty slow and I expect that NumPy has a much better way to do it.

147802,Why does Swing in my Java Applet flicker on fast mouse over? I made a Java Applet with some Standard GUI Components on it. I used the MigLayout Manager. If I move the mouse slowly over the various GUI Components everything appears to be fine but if I move the mouse fast it flickers. What could make that nasty ugly redraw? (Core 2 Duo 6300 2GB Ram Windows XP) One thought would be to check your code (and/or the MigLayout code) for unnecessary repaint() operations. Custom UIs and layouts can cause weird problems sometimes... You're right. Thanks. I found out that I used a custom component which registered a MouseListener.  I found the bugger: I used a custom ClosableTabbedPaint Class.  you could use double buffering in java applet to improve screen refreshing speed. ask more if details needed..

893657,"How do I calculate r-squared using Python and Numpy? I'm using Python and Numpy to calculate a best fit polynomial of arbitrary degree. I pass a list of x values y values and the degree of the polynomial I want to fit (linear quadratic etc.). This much works but I also want to calculate r (coefficient of correlation) and r-squared(coefficient of determination). I am comparing my results with Excel's best-fit trendline capability and the r-squared value it calculates. Using this I know I am calculating r-squared correctly for linear best-fit (degree equals 1). However my function does not work for polynomials with degree greater than 1. Excel is able to do this. How do I calculate r-squared for higher-order polynomials using Numpy? Here's my function: import numpy # Polynomial Regression def polyfit(x y degree): results = {} coeffs = numpy.polyfit(x y degree) # Polynomial Coefficients results['polynomial'] = coeffs.tolist() correlation = numpy.corrcoef(x y)[01] # r results['correlation'] = correlation # r-squared results['determination'] = correlation**2 return results @leif -- The request boils down to ""do it like Excel does"". I'm getting the feeling from these answers that the users may be reading too much into the r-squared value when using a non-linear best-fit curve. Nonetheless I'm not a math wizard and this is the requested functionality. Note: you use the degree only in the calculation of coeffs. tydok is correct. You are calculating the correlation of x and y and r-squared for y=p_0 + p_1 * x. See my answer below for some code that should work. If you don't mind me asking what is your ultimate goal? Are you doing model selection (choosing what degree to use)? Or something else? I have been using this successfully where x and y are array-like. def rsquared(x y): """""" Return R^2 where x and y are array-like."""""" slope intercept r_value p_value std_err = scipy.stats.linregress(x y) return r_value**2  From the numpy.polyfit documentation it is fitting linear regression. Specifically numpy.polyfit with degree 'd' fits a linear regression with the mean function E(y|x) = p_d * x**d + p_{d-1} * x **(d-1) + ... + p_1 * x + p_0 So you just need to calculate the R-squared for that fit. The wikipedia page on linear regression gives full details. You are interested in R^2 which you can calculate in a couple of ways the easisest probably being SST = Sum(i=1..n) (y_i - y_bar)^2 SSReg = Sum(i=1..n) (y_ihat - y_bar)^2 Rsquared = SSReg/SST Where I use 'y_bar' for the mean of the y's and 'y_ihat' to be the fit value for each point. I'm not terribly familiar with numpy (I usually work in R) so there is probably a tidier way to calculate your R-squared but the following should be correct import numpy # Polynomial Regression def polyfit(x y degree): results = {} coeffs = numpy.polyfit(x y degree) # Polynomial Coefficients results['polynomial'] = coeffs.tolist() # r-squared p = numpy.poly1d(coeffs) # fit values and mean yhat = p(x) # or [p(z) for z in x] ybar = numpy.sum(y)/len(y) # or sum(y)/len(y) ssreg = numpy.sum((yhat-ybar)**2) # or sum([ (yihat - ybar)**2 for yihat in yhat]) sstot = numpy.sum((y - ybar)**2) # or sum([ (yi - ybar)**2 for yi in y]) results['determination'] = ssreg / sstot return results Thank you this explanation is very clear to me. I'm going to try this one out. No problem glad to help. Exactly what I was looking for. I just want to point out that using the numpy array functions instead of list comprehension will be much faster e.g. numpy.sum((yi - ybar)**2) and easier to read According to wiki page http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination the most general definition of R^2 is `R^2 = 1 - SS_err/SS_tot` with `R^2 = SS_reg/SS_tot` being just a special case.  The wikipedia article on r-squareds suggests that it may be used for general model fitting rather than just linear regression.  R-squared is a statistic that only applies to linear regression. Essentially it measures how much variation in your data can be explained by the linear regression. So you calculate the ""Total Sum of Squares"" which is the total squared deviation of each of your outcome variables from their mean. . . \sum_{i}(y_{i} - y_bar)^2 where y_bar is the mean of the y's. Then you calculate the ""regression sum of squares"" which is how much your FITTED values differ from the mean \sum_{i}(yHat_{i} - y_bar)^2 and find the ratio of those two. Now all you would have to do for a polynomial fit is plug in the y_hat's from that model but it's not accurate to call that r-squared. Here is a link I found that speaks to it a little. This seems to be the root of my problem. How does Excel get a different r-squared value for a polynomial fit vs. a linear regression then? are you just giving excel the fits from a linear regression and the fits from a polynomial model? It's going to calculate the rsq from two arrays of data and just assume that you're giving it the fits from a linear model. What are you giving excel? What is the 'best fit trendline' command in excel? It's part of the graphing functions of Excel. You can plot some data right-click on it then choose from several different types of trend lines. There is the option to see the equation of the line as well as an r-squared value for each type. The r-squared value is also different for each type. @Travis Beale -- you are going to get a different r-squared for each different mean function you try (unless two models are nested and the extra coeffecients in the larger model all work to be 0). So of course Excel gives a different r-squared values. @Baltimark -- this is linear regression so it is r-squared.  A very late reply but just in case someone needs a ready function for this: scipy.stats.stats.linregress i.e. slope intercept r_value p_value std_err = scipy.stats.linregress(x y) as in @Adam Marples's answer.

367565,How do I build a numpy array from a generator? How can I build a numpy array out of a generator object? Let me illustrate the problem: >>> import numpy >>> def gimme(): ... for x in xrange(10): ... yield x ... >>> gimme() <generator object at 0x28a1758> >>> list(gimme()) [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9] >>> numpy.array(xrange(10)) array([0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]) >>> numpy.array(gimme()) array(<generator object at 0x28a1758> dtype=object) >>> numpy.array(list(gimme())) array([0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]) In this instance gimme() is the generator whose output I'd like to turn into an array. However the array constructor does not iterate over the generator it simply stores the generator itself. The behaviour I desire is that from numpy.array(list(gimme())) but I don't want to pay the memory overhead of having the intermediate list and the final array in memory at the same time. Is there a more space-efficient way? This is an interesting issue. I came accross this by `from numpy import *; print any(False for i in range(1))` - which shadows the built-in [`any()`](http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#any) and produces the opposite result (as I know now). @moooeeeep that's terrible. if `numpy` can't (or doesn't want to) to treat generators as Python does at least it should raise an exception when it receives a generator as an argument. @max I stepped on exact same mine. Apparently this was raised [on the NumPy list](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.python.numeric.general/47681/focus=47702) (and [earlier](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.python.numeric.general/13197)) concluding that this will not be changed to raise exception and one should always use namespaces. Numpy arrays require their length to be set explicitly at creation time unlike python lists. This is necessary so that space for each item can be consecutively allocated in memory. Consecutive allocation is the key feature of numpy arrays: this combined with native code implementation let operations on them execute much quicker than regular lists. Keeping this in mind it is technically impossible to take a generator object and turn it into an array unless you either: (a) can predict how many elements it will yield when run: my_array = numpy.zeros(predict_length()) for i el in enumerate(gimme()): my_array[i] = el (b) are willing to store its elements in an intermediate list : my_array = numpy.array(list(gimme())) (c) can make two identical generators run through the first one to find the total length initialize the array and then run through the generator again to find each element: length = sum(1 for el in gimme()) my_array = numpy.zeros(length) for i el in enumerate(gimme()): my_array[i] = el (a) is probably what you're looking for. (b) is space inefficient and (c) is time inefficient (you have to go through the generator twice). Thanks that makes alot of sense. The builtin `array.array` is a contiguous non-linked list and you can simply `array.array('f' generator)`. To say say it's impossible is misleading. It's just dynamic allocation. Why numpy.array doesn't do the memory allocation the same way as the builtin array.array as Cuadue says. What is the tradeof? I ask because there is contiguous allocated memory in both examples. Or not? numpy assumes its array sizes to not change. It relies heavily on different views of the same chunk of memory so allowing arrays to be expanded and reallocated would require an additional layer of indirection to enable views for example.  One google behind this stackoverflow result I found that there is a numpy.fromiter(data dtype count). The default count=-1 takes all elements from the iterable. It requires a dtype to be set explicitly. In my case this worked: numpy.fromiter(something.generate(from_this_input) float) Interesting I shall try it the next time I need it. how would you apply this to the question? `numpy.fromiter(gimme() float count=-1)` does not work. What does `something` stand for? something.generate is just the name of the generator @Matthias009 `numpy.fromiter(gimme() float count=-1)` works for me. A thread explaining why `fromiter` only works on 1D arrays: http://mail.scipy.org/pipermail/numpy-discussion/2007-August/028898.html. fwiw `count=-1` does not need to be specified as it is the default.

1450023,"openGL and STL? I am using openGL and am currently passing it a vertex array. The problem is that I have to create many vertices and add them in between one another (for order). This means that using a regular array is pretty annoying/inefficient. I want to use a data structure from STL so that I can efficiently (and easily) put new vertices at any index. The problem is that openGL expects a regular array. Does anyone know how to go about this? Is there an easy way to convert from an STL vector to an array? I am using openGL 1.1 Thanks vector<int> array; ..... functionThatAcceptsArray(&array[0]); // yes this is standard  It depends on how much control you need over your intermediate data representations and how much you are able to precalculate. For a compromise between freedom and memory usage read about the Winged Edge data structure. The structure allows quick access and traversal between vertices edges and faces and works like a doubled linked-list. If you implement the concept and make an iterator implementation for it you can use std::copy to copy the data into any STL container. As the rest of the folks have already mentioned use std::vector as the final representation when OpenGL needs the data. And lastly: Don't be afraid to have several instances of the same data!  OpenGL requires a contiguous array of elements. For hopefully obvious reasons there is no efficient way to insert a single element into a contiguous array. It is necessarily at least O(N). However you potentially could add N elements in less than the O(N^2) that the vector achieves for N random insertions. For example if you don't actually add new vertices ""at any index"" but always close to the previous one you could add all the elements to a std::list (O(1) per element O(N) total) then copy the std::list to a std::vector. In fact it doesn't have to be the previous element just a previous element so if the order is based on a recursive traversal of some tree then you might still be able to do this. If new vertices are added at an index determined by some linear order then add all the elements to a std::map or std::multi_map (O(log N) per element O(N log N) total) then copy that to a vector. So the lowest-complexity way of doing it depends on how the order is determined. Whether these lower-complexity solutions are actually faster than the vector depends on N. They have much higher overheads (O(N) allocations instead of O(log N) for the vector) so N might have to be pretty big before the asymptotic behaviour kicks in. If you do use either of the solutions I describe then the easy/efficient way to copy either a list or a map to a vector is like this: std::vector<glVertex3f> vec; vec.reserve(listormap.size()); vec.insert(vec.begin() listormap.begin() listormap.end());  You can use a pointer to the first address of the vector as an array pointer.

As for the second question delete has been suggested before: p = np.delete(p 2 axis=1) Which restores the original array again: array([[1 2] [3 4]])  A useful alternative answer to the first question using the examples from tomeedee��s answer would be to use numpy��s vstack and column_stack methods: Given a matrix p >>> import numpy as np >>> p = np.array([ [12]  [34] ]) an augmented matrix can be generated by: >>> p = np.vstack( [ p  [5  6] ] ) >>> p = np.column_stack( [ p  [ 7  8  9 ] ] ) >>> p array([[1 2 7] [3 4 8] [5 6 9]]) These methods may be convenient in practice than np.append() as they allow 1D arrays to be appended to a matrix without any modification in contrast to the following scenario: >>> p = np.array([ [ 1  2 ]  [ 3  4 ]  [ 5  6 ] ] ) >>> p = np.append( p  [ 7  8  9 ]  1 ) Traceback (most recent call last): File ""<stdin>"" line 1 in <module> File ""/usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/numpy/lib/function_base.py"" line 3234 in append return concatenate((arr values) axis=axis) ValueError: arrays must have same number of dimensions In answer to the second question a nice way to remove rows and columns is to use logical array indexing as follows: Given a matrix p >>> p = np.arange( 20 ).reshape( ( 4  5 ) ) suppose we want to remove row 1 and column 2: >>> r  c = 1  2 >>> p = p [ np.arange( p.shape[0] ) != r  : ] >>> p = p [ :  np.arange( p.shape[1] ) != c ] >>> p array([[ 0 1 3 4] [10 11 13 14] [15 16 18 19]]) Note - for reformed Matlab users - if you wanted to do these in a one-liner you need to index twice: >>> p = np.arange( 20 ).reshape( ( 4  5 ) ) >>> p = p [ np.arange( p.shape[0] ) != r  : ] [ :  np.arange( p.shape[1] ) != c ] This technique can also be extended to remove sets of rows and columns so if we wanted to remove rows 0 & 2 and columns 1 2 & 3 we could use numpy's setdiff1d function to generate the desired logical index: >>> p = np.arange( 20 ).reshape( ( 4  5 ) ) >>> r = [ 0  2 ] >>> c = [ 1  2  3 ] >>> p = p [ np.setdiff1d( np.arange( p.shape[0] ) r )  : ] >>> p = p [ :  np.setdiff1d( np.arange( p.shape[1] )  c ) ] >>> p array([[ 5 9] [15 19]])  I find it much easier to ""extend"" via assigning in a bigger matrix. E.g. import numpy as np p = np.array([[12] [34]]) g = np.array(range(20)) g.shape = (45) g[0:2 0:2] = p Here are the arrays: p  array([[1 2] [3 4]]) g: array([[ 0 1 2 3 4] [ 5 6 7 8 9] [10 11 12 13 14] [15 16 17 18 19]]) and the resulting g after assignment:  array([[ 1 2 2 3 4] [ 3 4 7 8 9] [10 11 12 13 14] [15 16 17 18 19]])",python arrays math numpy,2.295183098282917E-4,0.009708777444298043,0.00498718015775472,0.9850745240881189
207557,"What's the best way to add a self-update feature to a Java Swing application? I'm trying to figure out a way to add a self-update feature to a Java/Swing application I'm working on. Basically I've got a bunch of jar files with extra functionality to be re-deployed to the installed users when they change. Nothing complicated just check if a new version has been released download them over HTTP and then optionally offer to restart the app to the user. I had a look at webstart and it could work. But this particular app does some funky stuff with classloading and GC memory settings that don't look like they are supported via webstart or will at least complicate matters. (It's a tweaked build of JMeter) I also went down the road of adding in this plugin handler http://swing-fx.blogspot.com/2008/06/add-auto-update-and-plugins-to-your.html but it is very alpha and tries to do too much with the usual bugs you get with alpha stuff. Updates plugins separation of concern etc. are exactly what OSGi is about - you might want to take a look at this. It won't come free (read: with a steep initial learning curve especially when you are currently using classloading tricks) at least there are good open source implementations (felix - see felix.apache.org equinox - see www.eclipse.org and others) For these implementations autoupdaters are available - if you write your modules correctly it's possible to update at runtime without restarting.  I would definitely first try out Webstart. We've had lots of success launching even the early Eclipse RCP apps using Webstart and you can probably not get more funky classloading issues than with the OSGI framework (Eclipse Equinox). Could you perhaps give some more detail in your question about you classloading approach? Regarding the GC and other VM settings: these are easy to specify in your JNLP (Java Network Launching Protocol) files used by Webstart for launching apps. Could you give a link to an RCP app? Do you mean a RCP app that can be webstarted? The one's I worked on are all for intranet type enterprise applications so not available on the web.  The Java Web Start is good choice. The GC stuff is not important. Classloading could be problem. But when you got trusted by user you can grant AllPermisions and you will be able to do custom classloading. Maybe it will be good to reconsider funky stuff with classloading. It is really necessary? Or look at NetBeans. There should be found inspiration for auto-update.  I did the exact same thing. But that was long back so there are probably better tools today. What I found out I needed was a loader. The loader main program did not have the app jars in classpath. It first downloaded an update if required and then created a custom classloader with the app jars in class path and invoked the main method of the application main class. It is not very complicated. IIRC I needed to do this because the jars could not be overwritten in windows if they were already in classpath. Hope this helps. That seemed to be the easiest way all round. I kept an XML file on the server and a replica of it locally listing all the files to be updated and a version number. Quick and simple but does the trick.  we had a swing app 6 years ago that had self-update. like you suggested 1)it downloaded the latest jars over http 2) copied them to a folder. 3) since the swing app is launched using a .BAT file after user said YES we would shut down the swing app and look for any files in the update folder. if yes launch another .BAT file to copy the NEW JARs to the required directory. 4) then re launch the swing app.  I believe you should look again at Java WebStart or at least detail the ""funky classloading"" which you think is going to cause problems (as it might also cause problems with any solution proposed here). IIRC you can set command line parameters using Java WebStart ( http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/javaws/developersguide/syntax.html#resources ).",java swing,2.4075491449548808E-4,0.9991222501262835,3.3560575533961507E-4,3.013892038812449E-4
752482,"Can I compile numpy & scipy as eggs for free on Windows32? I've been asked to provide Numpy & Scipy as python egg files. Unfortunately Numpy and Scipy do not make official releases of their product in .egg form for a Win32 platform - that means if I want eggs then I have to compile them myself. At the moment my employer provides Visual Studio.Net 2003 which will compile no version of Numpy later than 1.1.1 - every version released subsequently cannot be compiled with VS2003. What I'd really like is some other compiler I can use perhaps for free but at a push as a free time-limited trial... I can use that to compile the eggs. Is anybody aware of another compiler that I can get and use without paying anything and will definitely compile Numpy on Windows? Please only suggest something if you know for a fact that that it will compile Numpy - no speculation! Thanks Notes: I work for an organization which is very sensitive about legal matters so everything I do has to be totally legit. I've got to do everything according to licensed terms and will be audited. My environment: Windows 32 Standard C Python 2.4.4 Try compiling the whole Python stack with MinGW32. This is a GCC-Win32 development environment that can be used to build Python and a wide variety of software. You will probably have to compile the whole Python distribution with it. Here is a guide to compiling Python with MinGW. Note that you will probably have to provide a python distribution that is compiled with MinGW32 as well. If recompiling the Python distro is not a goer I believe that Python 2.4 is compiled using VS2003. You are probably stuck with back-porting Scipy and Numpy to VS2003 or paying a consultant to do it. I would dig out the relevant mailing lists or contact the maintainers and get some view of the effort that would be required to do it. Another alternative would be to upgrade the version of Python to a more recent one but you will probably have to regression test your application and upgrade the version of Visual Studio to 2005 or 2008. No good - we use a stock CPython from python.org. We cannot use a special python. :-( There is absolutely no need to build your own python to build numpy (or any package for that matter) with mingw.  If you just need the compiler it is part of the .NET framework. For instance you can find the 3.5 framework (Which is used be visual studio 2008) in: ""C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v3.5"" You cannot reliably compile numpy (or any python extension) for python 2.4 with VS 2008. You need to use the same compiler as the one python itself was built with which is VS 2003 in python 2.4 case  You could try GCC for Windows. GCC is the compiler most often used for compiling Numpy/Scipy (or anything else really) on Linux so it seems reasonable that it should work on Windows too. (Never tried it myself though) And of course it's distributed under the GPL so there shouldn't be any legal barriers. The GCC coming with mingw is support by numpy. It is actually the compiler I use to build the official windows installers.",python windows numpy scipy,3.1471033417263054E-4,0.7556673862417981,4.3869758436506485E-4,0.2435792058396643
1733488,"Terrain minimap in OpenGL? So I have what is essentially a game... There is terrain in this game. I'd like to be able to create a top-down view minimap so that the ""player"" can see where they are going. I'm doing some shading etc on the terrain so I'd like that to show up in the minimap as well. It seems like I just need to create a second camera and somehow get that camera's display to show up in a specific box. I'm also thinking something like a mirror would work. I'm looking for approaches that I could take that would essentially give me the same view I currently have just top down... Does this seem feasible? Feel free to ask questions... Thanks! Well I don't have an answer to your specific question but it's common in games to render the world to an image using an orthogonal perspective from above and use that for the minimap. It would at least be less performance intensive than rendering it on the fly.  One way to do this is to create an FBO (frame buffer object) with a render buffer attached render your minimap to it and then bind the FBO to a texture. You can then map the texture to anything you'd like generally a quad. You can do this for all sorts of HUD objects. This also means that you don't have to redraw the contents of your HUD/menu objects as often as your main view; update the the associated buffer only as often as you require. You will often want to downsample (in the polygon count sense) the objects/scene you are rendering to the FBO for this case. The functions in the API you'll want to check into are: glGenFramebuffersEXT glBindFramebufferEXT glGenRenderbuffersEXT glBindRenderbufferEXT glRenderbufferStorageEXT glFrambufferRenderbufferEXT glFrambufferTexture2DEXT glGenerateMipmapEXT There is a write-up on using FBOs on gamedev.net. Another potential optimization is that if the contents of the minimap are static and you are simply moving a camera over this static view (truly just a map). You can render a portion of the map that is much larger than what you actually want to display to the player and fake a camera by adjusting the texture coordinates of the object it's mapped onto. This only works if your minimap is in orthographic projection. Would using multiple viewports also work? Can I render polygons to the frame buffer? Obviously I'm pretty noob to graphics programming haha. Yes you can draw to an FBO in exactly the same way that you draw normally in your window's frame buffer (the same as rendering to the back buffer before swapping with the front buffer). You can use different gluPerspective/gluLookAt's in each FBO. The benefit is that you don't have to redraw in the FBO if you don't need to for the current frame the FBO can be of any dimensions and it's very fast when used for textures as you don't need to use a glCopyTexImage. You can create many FBOs and switch between them with glBindFramebufferEXT (0 binds the window's framebuffer that your used to).",c++ opengl graphics,0.952014278070074,5.337278249460786E-4,4.562151838799215E-4,0.04699577892109996
160315,"How to check for key being held down on startup in Java I'm trying to write a resolution selection dialog that pops up when a program first starts up. To prevent boring the user I want to implement the fairly standard feature that you can turn off that dialog with a checkbox but get it back by holding down the alt key at startup. Unfortunately there is no obvious way to ask java whether a given key is currently being pressed. You can only register to be informed of new key presses via a KeyListener but that doesn't help if the keypress starts before the app launches. I don't know much about Java (mostly code in C#) but what about having a small loader program written in C or something that then launches your Java app with some parameters (like whether or not a certain key is down)? A difficult solution in that the program wants to run on Mac/Windows/Linux and that I don't know enough C. @Zarkonnen Does it have JVM bundled with the installer? If the answer is yes then the `KeyboadUtils.isPressed` would work on Windows Mac and Linux  public class LockingKeyDemo { static Toolkit kit = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit(); public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println(""caps lock2 = "" + kit.getLockingKeyState(KeyEvent.VK_CAPS_LOCK)); } } where should I import the Toolkit class from? has this solution overcome the problems described in this blog post? It kind of describes this method as unreliable but it's old.... http://weblogs.java.net/blog/2007/11/02/log-me-log-me-out  The original question seems to be not answered. The proposed method determines the locking key state like CapsLock ScrollLock etc. So it would not work for Alt pressed state. Consider the following code: com.sun.jna.platform.KeyboardUtils.isPressed(java.awt.event.KeyEvent.VK_ALT); The only problem is that this class is an internal Sun's JDK class and not likely to be available in any other JVM. Depend on your project it may or may not be acceptable. Internally it calls into User32.DLL on Windows: User32.INSTANCE.GetAsyncKeyState(...)  Well there are two types of key press detection: event based and polling. If you poll the keyboard for KEY_PRESSED on startup (through a loop with a sleep.thread(timeInMs) constantly checking if your key is down) then you can detect if it's already pressed on startup.  import java.awt.*; import java.awt.event.*; import javax.swing.JFrame; public class LockingKeyDemo { static Toolkit kit = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit(); public static void main(String[] args) { JFrame frame = new JFrame(); frame.addWindowListener(new WindowAdapter() { public void windowActivated(WindowEvent e) { System.out.println(""caps lock1 = "" + kit.getLockingKeyState(KeyEvent.VK_CAPS_LOCK)); try { Robot robot = new Robot(); robot.keyPress(KeyEvent.VK_CONTROL); robot.keyRelease(KeyEvent.VK_CONTROL); } catch (Exception e2) { System.out.println(e2); } System.out.println(""caps lock2 = "" + kit.getLockingKeyState(KeyEvent.VK_CAPS_LOCK)); } }); frame.addKeyListener(new KeyAdapter() { public void keyReleased(KeyEvent e) { System.out.println(""caps lock3 = "" + kit.getLockingKeyState(KeyEvent.VK_CAPS_LOCK)); } }); frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE); frame.setSize(200 200); frame.setLocationRelativeTo(null); frame.setVisible(true); } }  So it appears that you can do this but only for caps lock et al.

I'm really at my wits end on this one. I find you get better responses if you can reduce your source code to the absolute minimum example while still having the same issue. People don't want to do the work looking through 4 pages of source when you could reduce the problem to a 1 page simple example. Reduce your program to as simple a drawing program as possible. Setup your OpenGL window viewport etc and attempt to draw a single line. If it doesn't show up post that code here. Then when people see the issue with that you can apply the fix to your bigger problem. I haven't checked your code but one thing I always do when debugging this kind of problems is to set the clear color to something colorful like (1 0 1) or so. This will help you see if the problem is that your drawn object is completely black or if it's not drawn at all. EDIT: As someone mentioned in the comment: It also shows if you have a correct GL context if the clear operation clears to the right color or if it stays black. And to see if you've created a proper context where at least glClear works.  You're not checking the return values of the SDL-GL-SetAttribute() calls. And is 5/5/5/5 20-bpp color supported by your video card? agreed it's better to avoid being so specific without having a working environment yet!  Okay I managed to fix it using a lot of your suggestions and some other source code I had laying around. Turns out the problem was from 3 different lines. particlesize = 0.01; should have been bigger: particlesize = 1.01; glColor4i(255 255 255 255) was turning the cube the same color as the clear color because I was using it wrong. I couldn't figure out how to use it right so I'm using glColor4f(0.0f1.0f1.0f0.5f) instead and that works. Last of all gluLookAt(0 5 20 0 0 0 0 0 0) needed to be gluLookAt(0 5 20 0 0 0 0 1 0) Thank you all for your help and your time.  Check OpenGL for error states. Use glslDevil glIntercept or gDebugger. Check the glGetError function. Can you test whether SDL actually acquired a device context? Does the Window reflect changes in the glClearColor call? Don't use 0.5 as an alpha value in glClearColor. Try these suggestions and report back with a minimal example as Simucal suggested.",c++ opengl sdl,0.999763765581515,9.008347575301549E-5,7.700076243796433E-5,6.915018029396574E-5
1236695,"Is 'for x in array' always result in sorted x? [Python/NumPy] For arrays and lists in Python and Numpy are the following lines equivalent: itemlist = [] for j in range(len(myarray)): item = myarray[j] itemlist.append(item) and: itemlist = [] for item in myarray: itemlist.append(item) I'm interested in the order of itemlist. In a few examples that I have tried they are identical but is it guaranteed? For example I know that the foreach statement in C# doesn't guarantee order and that I should be careful with it. Oops yes I did mean to throw in a range() Did you mean: for j in range(len(myarray)): ? Yes it's entirely guaranteed. for item in myarray (where myarray is a sequence which includes numpy's arrays builtin lists Python's array.arrays etc etc) is in fact equivalent in Python to: _aux = 0 while _aux < len(myarray): item = myarray[_aux] ...etc... for some phantom variable _aux;-). Btw both of your constructs are also equivalent to itemlist = list(myarray) Thanks! Yeah I wasnt really trying to convert an array to a list just exploring the order.  It is guaranteed for lists. I think the more relevant Python parallel to your C# example would be to iterate over the keys in a dictionary which is NOT guaranteed to be in any order. # Always prints 0-9 in order a_list = [0123456789] for x in a_list: print x # May or may not print 0-9 in order. Implementation dependent. a_dict = {'0':0'1':1'2':2'3':3'4':4'5':5'6':6'7':7'8':8'9':9} for x in a_dict: print x The for <element> in <iterable> structure only worries that the iterable supplies a next() function which returns something. There is no general guarantee that these elements get returned in any order over the domain of the for..in statement; lists are a special case. Thanks for highlighting that arrays have a notion of order that it is implemented via the next() function. The for ... in ... structure takes advantage of next() and so data with an intrinsic order (arrays) implements next() differently than data without an intrinsic order (such as dictionaries.)

407343,"Where are Swing applications used? Are Swing applications really used nowadays? I don't find a place where they are used. Is it okay to skip the AWT and Swing package (I learned a bit of the basics though)? Related: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2994304/is-java-swing-still-in-use/2994324#2994324 You may checkout Swing Sightings. This website is hosted by SUN and it is dedicated to sw projects that use Swing. There are a lot of projects using Swing ... http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/tsc/sightings/ While I don't doubt Swing has it's place even today (and at the same time being an ugly and complex beast to get started with) the last sightings issue is from 2005 - so it cannot really prove that Swing is used _today_ ;) LandlordMax (http://www.LandlordMax.com) is a current desktop application that's based on Swing. I can assure you the Swing community is very alive! FYI: It was feature on Swing Sightings years ago.  Are you skipping it for an exam/interview? Besides really good apps like IntelliJ IDEA and NetBeans there are lots of Swing like frameworks [SWT (Eclipse) GWT etc.] which you can learn faster with Swing knowledge...  Hmmmm... how about NetBeans? You know the IDE? It uses Swing. oh thanks for the info ya i know and also eclipse While Eclipse is great IDE it doesn't use Swing but SWT.  Whenever you want to write a desktop GUI app for non-Windows OS you use Swing as the only sane and guaranteed cross-platform GUI framework. Besides Swing has a very good design. I recommend to learn it anyways to make yourself a better programmer.  You should probably be looking at JavaFX for future work. As the FAQ states Sun is not replacing Swing with JavaFX Script. Instead JavaFX Script makes Swing easier to use. Using/learning it will give you a very good understanding of the important Swing concepts and how they fit in with ""the future"". I haven't used JavaFX yet but heard very good things about it.  Skip AWT and Swing? To jump where? SWT? Web-based development? In the broader sense I have a number of Java applications although I am not too sure if they use Swing or SWT. Lot of database tools like SQuirreL SQL Client are written in Java. I think SQuirrel uses stuff from Netbean which is of course Swing based. yEd is written in Java probably Swing. A number of P2P softwares are written in Java including Frostwire (I see no trace of SWT there but I can just miss it). And this list is far from exhaustive! Lol! I forgot to mention the software suite made by the company I work for! It is quite specialized used by mobile phone companies to monitor health of their network nodes (superficially looks like a spreadsheet). Totally Swing based. Open Office is *not* written in Java (it's slow for other reasons ;)). Ah? Somebody already told me but before posting I checked and found lot of jar files (in program/classes). It has lot of DLL and exe files too indeed. Confusing at least. OpenOffice is written in C++ and supports Java plug-ins somehow.  If you are writing for the web exclusively you can probably skip Swing but otherwise you're absolutely going to run into it. I've never worked on a non-trivial Java app without a Swing GUI. Also Swing is one of the better APIs to use. If you use most others you are going to find them more difficult to use and/or platform incompatible. (If anyone reading this is aware of exceptions to this please leave comments I haven't looked for a while and am kind of curious if anything better has become available) Other JVM languages like JRuby and Jython are often used because of their access to Swing.  AWT I never actually learnt in full as swing is just a more sophisticated version knowing swing is very important if you have any intention of ever making a Java GUI application. will it be ever used for enterprise application development ?  There is no universal question to whether it is ok to skip something or not. It's a matter of priorities. While Swing has a lot to teach you (and it is too heavily infused with AWT) if you're never going to be writing GUIs you may be better off investing in something else. Swing while ugly as hell is still used in many places. A quick search on ""java swing"" in Indeed or dice would reveal many jobs and industries that require it. i find that the file choosers are very slow in swing - i hate them Swing while not great in many ways is far from ""ugly as hell"". It has many nice concepts and is quite good to use after a bit of experience is gained. And with recent font improvements makes it quite possible to write a GUI which is indistinguishable from a native app. Indistinguishable except that it resizes properly that is. You can write something pretty in every language but in my experience the vast majority of applications written with similar effort in Swing compared to other APIs tend to be clunkier less aesthetic and less robust. I always put the following right at the top of my `main` method to reduce the ugly-ness: `UIManager.setLookAndFeel(UIManager.getSystemLookAndFeelClassName());` (with the necessary try/catch). It's still not as beautiful as you might want it to be but it helps a lot.  You should certainly write Swing for desktop Java only using AWT to the degree that Swing demands it. I'm sure people can come up with examples of very good Swing apps besides SQL Squirrel and IntelliJ. I think that RIA technologies like Flex Silverlight etc. are ascendant because the web and services are taking mindshare from desktops. It's not just Swing that's losing out. ""certainly"" perhaps not there is at least the SWT alternative (which I didn't learn). I wouldn't consider SWT as a viable alternative but that's my personal choice.  IIRC jEdit is also a Swing app. Quite a popular text editor.  Check out Filthy Rich Clients. It explains some of the history of AWT and Swing. Swing being a lightweight alternative (successor) to most of the AWT classes.  While Swing has some cross-platform look-and-feel deficiencies and it would be nice if it was updated to support generics it is still well designed and quite usable. I have always been a fan of the sheer amount of customization offered. SWT is nice and is more native but you give up some power and control with that as well. In addition it seems simpler to use which can be a plus since Swing can be overly complex due to its flexibility.  Geertjan Wielenga often blogs about applications based on the NetBeans platform and therefore Swing. The applications range across the board from rather small esoteric applications to very large mission-critical systems (Boeing Aircraft comes to mind). Many of the enterprise-level applications that Geertjan misses are mentioned on Planet NetBeans. It seems like every few weeks there is an announcement or description of such a program. As noted above lots of tools use Swing including the IntelliJ IDEA IDE a favorite. I'm surprised no one else mentioned it. Sun also used to maintain a Swing Sightings web site but it hasn't been updated in a few years. Where I work Swing is used in the presentation layer for a very large document management system. In my own development experience I've used Swing for desktop applications in the areas of image processing device control (video motors etc.) math statistics and medical devices. BTW I agree about the slowness of file choosers. But there are lots of alternatives that will use the native file chooser. It can just be a bit jarring if the L&F's don't match up very well. EDIT: Oh and as others have mentioned it's very easy to use Swing from other languages on the JVM. With Clojure for example it is even easier to use than in Java in my opinion.  Swing is heavily used in business specific (vertical)/internal application development.  Swing applications are used in most cases where a Java app runs on the desktop. Sometimes you don't even know - for example LimeWire is a Java Swing application. When learning Swing you'll find that you will come to know those parts of AWT that are still important such as Event LayoutManager Graphics Font Color etc. Yes Azureus is an Eclipse RCP i.e. it uses SWT. azureus was developed in swing ? wow .. thanks for the info pal :) I believe that Azureus uses SWT toolkit (from of Eclipse) not Swing. OK edited my answer to fix that. Sorry for the mistake. I tend to agree. You won't even realize you're running Swing apps when they're done right. Unless you really look there's no way to tell our app (http://www.landlordmax.com) is a Swing app. No Azureus/Vuze is NOT Eclipse RCP based but on SWT.",java swing,1.0197098568496188E-4,0.9270531949501326,0.027098587021230518,0.04574624704295189

241342,Is it possible to display Swing components in a JSP? I was wondering if I could pop up JOptionPanes or other Swing components from within a browser using JSP. You may also want to consider GWT which enables you to develop a web interface in Java code (the Java code is converted to HTML & JavaScript by the GWT compiler). Although you don't program to the Swing API directly when writing GWT applications the GWT API is very similar in style to Swing programming.  If you embed an applet. But I don't think that's what you want. Swing is for desktop apps. JSP web pages. If you want components try looking into JSF or some of the many AJAX Javascript frameworks like prototype.  Assuming you're familiar with Swing you may want to introduce yourself to Apache Wicket which is very similar to the way you build web pages as Swing is to building GUI:s. That is in Wicket you add new instancef of Label Button DataTable etc. etc. to page and link those to bean property data which is then ultimately transformed to fully functioning web page.

85,"Flat File Databases What are your best practices around creating flat file database structures in PHP? A lot of the more mature PHP flat file frameworks I see out there attempt to implement SQL-like query syntax which is over the top for my purposes in most cases (I would just use a database at that point). Are there any elegant tricks out there to get good performance and features with the small code overhead one would want by taking on this problem in the first place? You might consider SQLite. It's almost as simple as flat files but you do get a SQL engine for querying. It works well with PHP too. SQLite was build into 5.0+ by default but discountinued (!) from PHP 5.4+ on !!! As I write this in July 2012 SQLite will not work on up-to-date systems anymore by default. Official statement [here](http://www.php.net/manual/en/sqlite.requirements.php) Installing the SQLite PDO driver is pretty trivial if you have server access. On Ubuntu/Debian running Apache2 just do apt-get install php5-sqlite service apache2 restart  This one is inspiring as a practical solution: https://github.com/mhgolkar/FlatFire It uses multiple strategies to handling data... [Copied from Readme File] Free or Structured or Mixed - STRUCTURED Regular (table row column) format. [DATABASE] / \ TX TableY \_____________________________ |ROW_0 Colum_0 Colum_1 Colum_2| |ROW_1 Colum_0 Colum_1 Colum_2| |_____________________________| - FREE More creative data storing. You can store data in any structure you want for each (free) element its similar to storing an array with a unique ""Id"". [DATABASE] / \ EX ElementY (ID) \________________ |Field_0 Value_0 | |Field_1 Value_1 | |Field_2 Value_2 | |________________| recall [ID]: get_free(""ElementY"") --> array([Field_0]=>Value_0[Field_1]=>Value_1... - MIXD (Mixed) Mixed databases can store both free elements and tables.If you add a table to a free db or a free element to a structured db flat fire will automatically convert FREE or SRCT to MIXD database. [DATABASE] / \ EX TY  One way to store flat-file content would be to save literal arrays to php files. For example: $data = array(); if( $_POST ) { $data = $_POST; $content = ""<?php\n""; $content .= '$data=' . var_export($data true) . ""\n""; $content .= ""?>""; save_to_file($filename $content); } // echo form `""Well what is the nature of the flat databases. Are they large or small. Is it simple arrays with arrays in them? if its something simple say userprofiles built as such: $user = array(""name"" => ""dubayou"" ""age"" => 20 ""websites"" => array(""dubayou.com""""willwharton.com""""codecream.com"") ""and_one"" => ""more""); and to save or update the db record for that user. $dir = ""../userdata/""; //make sure to put it bellow what the server can reach. file_put_contents($dir.$user['name']serialize($user)); and to load the record for the user function &get_user($name){ return unserialize(file_get_contents(""../userdata/"".$name)); } but again this implementation will vary on the application and nature of the database you need.  IMHO you have two options if you want to avoid homebrewing something: 1) SQLite If you're familiar with PDO you can install a PDO driver that supports SQLite. Never used it but I have used PDO a ton with MySQL. I'm going to give this a shot on a current project. 2) XML Done this many times for relatively small amounts of data. XMLReader is a lightweight read-forward cursor-style class. SimpleXML makes it simple to read an XML document into an object that you can access just like any other class instance.  If you're going to use a flat file to persist data use XML to structure the data. PHP has a built-in XML parser.  A low level object API flatfile database is Mimesis (an open source PHP flat file database low-level API).  If you want a human-readable result you can also use this type of file : ofaurax|27|male|something| another|24|unknown|| ... This way you have only one file you can debug it (and manually fix) easily you can add fields later (at the end of each line) and the PHP code is simple (for each line split according to |). However the drawbacks is that you should parse the entire file to search something (if you have millions of entry it's not fine) and you should handle the separator in data (for example if the nick is WaR|ordz).  That's true. serialize() can be pretty useful for that as well. You could serialize but this saves a step since you don't have to unserialize. Not sure if its actually better performance-wise. I think the trick to coming up with a viable system is finding some way to index the data nodes without killing yourself with complexity. Maybe have one central file that keeps track of all indexes? Like tags.txt which has a list of all post id's associated with each tags. May have to keep redundant data around to save time.  In my opinion using a ""Flat File Database"" in the sense you're meaning (and the answer you've accepted) isn't neccesarily the best way to go about things. First of all using serialize() and unserialize() can cause MAJOR headaches if someone gets in and edits the file (they can in fact put arbritrary code in your ""database"" to be run each time.) Personally I'd say - why not look to the future? There have been so many times that I've had issues because I've been creating my own ""proprietary"" files and the project has exploded to a point where it needs a database and I'm thinking ""you know I wish I'd written this for a database to start with"" - because the refactoring of the code takes way too much time and effort. From this I've learnt that future proofing my application so that when it gets bigger I don't have to go and spend days refactoring is the way to go forward. How do I do this? SQLite. It works as a database uses SQL and is pretty easy to change over to mySQL (espescially if you're using abstracted classes for database manipulation like I do!) In fact espescially with the ""accepted answer""'s method it can drastically cut the memory usage of your app (you don't have to load all the ""RECORDS"" into PHP)  I have written two simple functions designed to store data in a file. You can judge for yourself if it's useful in this case. The point is to save a php variable (if it's either an array a string or an object) to a file. <?php function varname(&$var) { $oldvalue=$var; $var='AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAQEAqytmUAQKMOj24lAjqKJC2Gyqhbhb+DmB9eDDb8+QcFI+QOySUpYDn884rgKB6EAtoFyOZVMA6HlNj0VxMKAGE+sLTJ40rLTcieGRCeHJ/TI37e66OrjxgB+7tngKdvoG5EF9hnoGc4eTMpVUDdpAK3ykqR1FIclgk0whV7cEn/6K4697zgwwb5R2yva/zuTX+xKRqcZvyaF3Ur0Q8T+gvrAX8ktmpE18MjnA5JuGuZFZGFzQbvzCVdN52nu8i003GEFmzp0Ny57pWClKkAy3Q5P5AR2BCUwk8V0iEX3iu7J+b9pv4LRZBQkDujaAtSiAaeG2cjfzL9xIgWPf+J05IQ=='; foreach($GLOBALS as $var_name => $value) { if ($value === 'AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAQEAqytmUAQKMOj24lAjqKJC2Gyqhbhb+DmB9eDDb8+QcFI+QOySUpYDn884rgKB6EAtoFyOZVMA6HlNj0VxMKAGE+sLTJ40rLTcieGRCeHJ/TI37e66OrjxgB+7tngKdvoG5EF9hnoGc4eTMpVUDdpAK3ykqR1FIclgk0whV7cEn/6K4697zgwwb5R2yva/zuTX+xKRqcZvyaF3Ur0Q8T+gvrAX8ktmpE18MjnA5JuGuZFZGFzQbvzCVdN52nu8i003GEFmzp0Ny57pWClKkAy3Q5P5AR2BCUwk8V0iEX3iu7J+b9pv4LRZBQkDujaAtSiAaeG2cjfzL9xIgWPf+J05IQ==') { $var=$oldvalue; return $var_name; } } $var=$oldvalue; return false; } function putphp(&$var $file=false) { $varname=varname($var); if(!$file) { $file=$varname.'.php'; } $pathinfo=pathinfo($file); if(file_exists($file)) { if(is_dir($file)) { $file=$pathinfo['dirname'].'/'.$pathinfo['basename'].'/'.$varname.'.php'; } } file_put_contents($file'<?php'.""\n\$"".$varname.'='.var_export($var true)."";\n""); return true; } This is a four-year-old question with an accepted answer and many additional answers. Consider focusing on newer questions unless the accepted answer here is clearly wrong or inadequate.  Here's the code we use for Lilina. It stores each entry as a separate file which we found is efficient enough for use (no unneeded data is loaded and it's faster to save).  Just pointing out a potential problem with a flat file database with this type of system: data|some text|more data row 2 data|bla hbalh|more data ...etc The problem is that the cell data contains a ""|"" or a ""\n"" then the data will be lost. Sometimes it would be easier to split by combinations of letters that most people wouldn't use. For example: Column splitter: #$% (Shift+345) Row splitter: ^&* (Shift+678) Text file: test data#$%blah blah#$%^&*new row#$%new row data 2 Then use: explode(""#$%"" $data); use foreach the explode again to separate columns Or anything along these lines. Also I might add that flat file databases are good for systems with small amounts of data (ie. less than 20 rows) but become huge memory hogs for larger databases.  That's true. serialize() can be pretty useful for that as well. I think the trick to coming up with a viable system is finding some way to index the data nodes without killing yourself with complexity. This is post #100! post 100 :D upvote  One framework I'm considering would be for a blogging platform. Since just about any possible view of data you would want would be sorted by date I was thinking about this structure: One directory per content node: ./content/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS/ Subdirectories of each node including /tags /authors /comments as well as simple text files in the node directory for pre- and post-rendered content and the like. This would allow a simple PHP glob() call (and probably a reversal of the result array) to query on just about anything within the content structure:glob(""content/*/tags/funny""); would return paths including all articles tagged ""funny"".",php sql database flat-file,0.0018793706165872205,0.14344619235084202,0.854564162858119,1.10274174451852E-4

1962980,"Selecting rows from a NumPy ndarray I want to select only certain rows from a NumPy array based on the value in the second column. For example this test array has integers from 1 to 10 in the second column. >>> test = numpy.array([numpy.arange(100) numpy.random.randint(1 11 100)]).transpose() >>> test[:10 :] array([[ 0 6] [ 1 7] [ 2 10] [ 3 4] [ 4 1] [ 5 10] [ 6 6] [ 7 4] [ 8 6] [ 9 7]]) If I wanted only rows where the second value is 4 it is easy: >>> test[test[: 1] == 4] array([[ 3 4] [ 7 4] [16 4] ... [81 4] [83 4] [88 4]]) But how do I achieve the same result when there is more than one wanted value? The wanted list can be of arbitrary length. For example I may want all rows where the second column is either 2 4 or 6: >>> wanted = [2 4 6] The only way I have come up with is to use list comprehension and then convert this back into an array and seems too convoluted although it works: >>> test[numpy.array([test[x 1] in wanted for x in range(len(test))])] array([[ 0 6] [ 3 4] [ 6 6] ... [90 2] [91 6] [92 2]]) Is there a better way to do this in NumPy itself that I am missing? numpy.in1d is what you are looking for: print test[numpy.in1d(test[:1] wanted)] It should easily be the fastest solution if wanted is large; plus it is the most readable one id say.  test[numpy.logical_or.reduce([test[:1] == x for x in wanted])] The result should be faster than the original version since NumPy's doing the inner loops instead of Python. This solution goes through the array len(wanted) times. It is usually faster to go through the array in a single pass. Thanks Amnon. This is the solution that I decided to accept. I think it is clear to understand and is about 20 x faster than my original solution.  The following solution should be faster than Amnon's solution as wanted gets larger: wanted_set = set(wanted) # Much faster look up than with lists for larger lists @numpy.vectorize def selected(elmt): return elmt in wanted_set # Or: selected = wanted_set.__contains__ print test[selected(test[: 1])] In fact it has the advantage of searching through the test array only once (instead of len(wanted) times). It also uses Python's built-in fast element look up in sets which are much faster for this than lists. It is also fast because it uses Numpy's fast loops. You also get the optimization of the in operator: once a wanted element matches the remaining elements do not have to be tested (as opposed to the ""logical or"" approach of Amnon were all the elements in wanted are tested no matter what). Alternatively you could use the following one-liner which also goes through your array only once: test[numpy.apply_along_axis(lambda x: x[1] in wanted 1 test)] This is much much slower though as this extracts the element in the second column at each iteration (instead of doing it in one pass as in the first solution of this answer). @Amnon: Good point and interesting results. Thanks! These solutions call python for every element instead of using numpy's comparison. According to my tests your first solution is faster than mine for len(wanted)=50 but slower for len(wanted)=5. EOL many thanks for your time and effort. Your explanations were clear. I chose to use Amnon's solution because for my usual scenario (len(test) about 1000 and len(wanted) about 3-5) that was faster than your first solution. The speed difference is not huge but I also found it clearer. But it was good to be reminded of numpy's vectorize and I am sure I will find a use for it soon.  This is two times faster than Amnon's variant for len(test)=1000: wanted = (246) wanted2 = numpy.expand_dims(wanted 1) print test[numpy.any(test[: 1] == wanted2 0) :] @ahatchkins: Some typos in your version. What you are suggesting is this - # convert wanted list into a one column array wanted = numpy.array(wanted).reshape((len(wanted)1)) # print test[numpy.any(test[:1] == wanted 0)] In my tests this is about 2 times faster than Amnon's solution.

I don't know what you mean by ""just dies"". Does the UI still redraw itself if you drag it outside your screen edge and then back in? Does the entire process eventually terminate unexpectedly? Does the entire process immediately terminate unexpectedly? Assuming the UI is still there when you click a button and nothing seems to be happening another easy way to diagnose what might be going wrong is to monitor that process' CPU and memory usage. Task Manager (or better Process Explorer) if you're in Windows; ps if you're some flavor of Unix (and probably Mac as well). Check how much CPU that process is using first. If it's 0% then you probably have something benign like the button having no listener (and hence clicking it has no effect whatsoever). If it's 100% then you probably have some business logic running like mad possibly in an infinite loop. Two things to look at: one check memory usage and see whether it's going up; a bug could be causing large numbers of objects to be created and you'll eventually run out of memory. It's impossible to say for sure without knowing what the code does. The second thing is mentioned above: drag the UI offscreen and then back. Java's EDT (Event Dispatch Thread) is responsible for handling all UI events including redrawing the UI when it is made visible; if it doesn't do that then you know something is running in the EDT that shouldn't be keeping it from getting around to doing things like redraws. For all I know the business logic is working just fine but merely takes a while and is hogging the EDT. (If it's just under 50% 33% 25% etc. then you're on a multiple-CPU machine; see 100% above...) From your description however (namely ""the logs just end"") it sounds like your UI or business logic is waiting on something that'll never come so you'll have 0% CPU on that process. Worth checking anyway since it's quick and can head off a needless bug hunt in the wrong place.  You must have an event listener waiting for the mouse clicked event. Did you trace through that code to a specific line? The code must at least reach the first line I can't see the event listener not working. You'll need to break it down a bit. And if it's only got one line then you need to drill into that code until you have more than one line or until you can isolate it some more...  the application is running on java 1.6. and the entire process immediately terminate unexpectedly. One other piece of information is that the swing app is started using webstart. i'm are looking through code based on the last line in the log to see if i can figure out what's happening. unfortunately this has happened before and each time at a different point so i haven't been able to reproduce. we'll probably end up eventually using the Thread.setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler() suggestion and see if we can get more info. any more thought are welcome. thanks so much for the help  Which version of java and what machine? In any case here's the scoop: the event queue thread runs somewhat separately from the main thread. In Java < 5 there was a bug that made it difficult to capture events from that thread so some exceptions just went away. In Java 5 there's a new method Thread.setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler() that will let you set up an exception handler for anything that might otherwise have gone uncaught. Add a handler there and catch all Throwables and log them. This is also a good hack for dealing with things you might otherwise call System.exit() for as well; have a normalExit Throwable; throw that anywhere you'd call exit in the GUI and make sure all gets cleaned up. Charlie: I think of myself as pretty Java savant and this is one new feature of the language I definitely didn't know about. Thanks for sharing it!

3539529,"Tips on writing SQL for multiple databases Different databases have differences in SQL support & implementation. Sometimes there is a difference in SQL syntax sometimes support for some SQL commands is missing sometimes the database has a feature that other databases do not have. What are considered to be good practices in writing SQL queries that are good for different databases (MySQL PostgreSQL Oracle MSSQL SQLite) taking in account that the developer uses a framework (like CakePHP Codeigniter Zend etc.) that provides a database abstraction layer? What SQL syntax should the developer try to avoid? Sometimes ORMs do not handle the query correctly. F.ex. `FULL JOIN` in MySQL `RIGHT JOIN` in SQLite. I mean the syntax of the query is good but the database does not support that. That's what ORMs are there for. As quantumSoup alluded to just don't. If you take a look at each of the frameworks you listed you'll notice that they all use ORM or some kind of database abstraction layer for inserting/extracting data. This allows you to write db-neutral code that works irrespective to the desired data source. The ORM then uses the correct data source ""drivers"" to convert your intentions into commands understood by each data source. So the trick is 1.) defining a universal interface for your ORM or database abstraction layer; and then 2.) writing the appropriate drivers for the ORM. Then each time you want to use a new type of data source (including flat files or CSV) it's a simple matter of adding a new driver. Sometimes I can create queries with syntax that is not supported by currently used database. F.ex. `FULL JOIN` in MySQL. I was able to create the query that passed through DB abstraction layer and that was looking okay. But the current database did not support that syntax.  ""Cautiously use ANSI SQL"" is the most direct answer to your question. However keep in mind these words from Jeremy Zawodny especially: Good engineers try to select the best tools for the job and then do everything they can to take advantage of their tool's unique and most powerful features. In the database world that means specific hints indexing data types and even table structure decisions. If you truly limit yourself to the subset of features that is common across all major RDBMSes you're doing yourself and your clients a huge disservice. What people are really looking for with ORM is a non-relational data store that can be easily transformed into programming language data structures (e.g. Ruby objects). If you need this you might want to examine one of the many ""NoSQL"" options out there (MongoDB CouchDB are two of the more mature ones). In practice you are probably better off to pick a particular DBMS and then freely use any proprietary features that strike your fancy. Of course this isn't always possible like if you're trying to write a package to be sold to people whose DBMS choices you can't control (or you don't want to limit your market).  You can use an ORM for example which will essentially abstract away the details from each database. Although you have to make sure your ORM supports all the databases needed. Doctrine and Propel are good friends of php. Check either out. If you cannot find an ORM that supports all your DB's then perhaps find one that covers most and extend php to handle the last. Although I doubt this will be the case.  Then you dig into using ORM you'll find that for complex queries - it doesn't perform. It's hard enough for people to write SQL that performs well - I don't expect a DB abstraction layer fair any better. Most ORMs support native stored procedures... which defeats the purpose of using ORM. ANSI SQL is striving to make SQL more portable amongst databases but adoption varies from vendor to vendor. And ANSI syntax doesn't necessarily mean it performs as well as native syntax (IE: COALESCE vs native ISNULL/IFNULL/NVL/etc). The reality is for getting the best performing database interaction you need to write custom code for each vendor involved. Some would use this as a point to why the database should be nothing more than basic persistence because it's easier to maintain a central application. But this pales when you deal with high usage applications who suffer because of multiple trips between the application and the database poor data typing and table design. Frankly it's a waste of a database... I completely agree. An abstraction layer will only ensure that your application runs equally slow on all DBMS  You are looking for Object-relational mapping (ORM). Object-relational mapping (ORM O/RM and O/R mapping) in computer software is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems in object-oriented programming languages. This creates in effect a ""virtual object database"" that can be used from within the programming language. You can go for famous Doctrine out there.

For example: xy1=numpy.array( [[ 243 3173] [ 525 2997]]) xy2=numpy.array( [[ 682 2644] [ 277 2651] [ 396 2640]]) My current method loops through each coordinate xy in xy1 and calculates the distances between that coordinate and the other coordinates. mindist=numpy.zeros(len(xy1)) minid=numpy.zeros(len(xy1)) for ixy in enumerate(xy1): dists=numpy.sqrt(numpy.sum((xy-xy2)**2axis=1)) mindist[i]minid[i]=dists.min()dists.argmin() Is there a way to eliminate the for loop and somehow do element-by-element calculations between the two arrays? I envision generating a distance matrix for which I could find the minimum element in each row or column. Another way to look at the problem. Say I concatenate xy1 (length m) and xy2 (length p) into xy (length n) and I store the lengths of the original arrays. Theoretically I should then be able to generate a n x n distance matrix from those coordinates from which I can grab an m x p submatrix. Is there a way to efficiently generate this submatrix? If you need to speed up your code you should remove the unnecessary numpy.sqrt (and only take the square root of the minimum squared distance when you have found it). For what you're trying to do: dists = numpy.sqrt((xy1[: 0 numpy.newaxis] - xy2[: 0])**2 + (xy1[: 1 numpy.newaxis - xy2[: 1])**2) mindist = numpy.min(dists axis=1) minid = numpy.argmin(dists axis=1) Edit: Instead of calling sqrt doing squares etc. you can use numpy.hypot: dists = numpy.hypot(xy1[: 0 numpy.newaxis]-xy2[: 0] xy1[: 1 numpy.newaxis]-xy2[: 1]) Oh my that's amazing. I did not realize that element-by-element could work that way too. So `xy1[:0numpy.newaxis]` effectively replaces my for loop by being a column vector from which all the *x*-values of `xy2` are subtracted. Very cool thank you. Yes. For a more general and elegant method see Alex's answer. @fideli: help(numpy.subtract.outer) tells you that the numpy.newaxis trick of Alok is what is also at work in Alex's answer.

With the right scaling not much at all: # L1 / dim ~ .33 +- .2/sqrt dim # L2 / sqrt dim ~ .4 +- .2/sqrt dim # Lmax / 2 ~ .4 +- .2/sqrt dim Hello I actually just came across this last week. Much faster too! @LWZ just what you have -- `np.array([ dist( x y ) for x y in zip( X Y )])` @denis cdist calculate distances between ALL pairs. How can I distance only between corresponding elements for example `[ dist(X[0]Y[0]) dist(X[1]Y[1]) ... dist(X[N]Y[N]) ]` assuming `X` and `Y` are of same length `N`? This works! And pretty fast. Just a note that the elements to calculate must be of length 2 otherwise python will raise an error. For a list of points in a contour detected by opencv2 I needed to use reshape function of numpy to reshape it first... @denis: well e.g. the result of cv2.findContours is something like this: [ [[x1 y1]] [[x2 y2]].....[[xn yn]] ]. I don't know why they put the coordinates in 2 square bracket but if you apply cdist directly to the list each element will only have length 1 (a list containing 1 list inside) I have to reshape it so the contour become the list of length-2 element (which means flat out the double bracket) @Jim Raynor right -- cdist expects arrays with ndim == 2 should check can you post an example of how to use it? there are none in the docs  To compute the m by p matrix of distances this should work: >>> def distances(xy1 xy2): ... d0 = numpy.subtract.outer(xy1[:0] xy2[:0]) ... d1 = numpy.subtract.outer(xy1[:1] xy2[:1]) ... return numpy.hypot(d0 d1) the .outer calls make two such matrices (of scalar differences along the two axes) the .hypot calls turns those into a same-shape matrix (of scalar euclidean distances). +1: just learned about the properties of Numpy's ufuncs!

679113,"Trouble porting OpenGL app to Windows I am trying to move an OpenGL app to Windows. It was my understanding that Windows had a decent OpenGL implementation. But I'm starting to think that it doesn't... Specifically I use array buffers and glDrawArrays. When I tried to compile my code in Visual Studio 2008 Pro I received the following errors: vertexbuffers.cpp(31) : error C3861: 'glGenBuffers': identifier not found vertexbuffers.cpp(32) : error C2065: 'GL_ARRAY_BUFFER' : undeclared identifier vertexbuffers.cpp(32) : error C3861: 'glBindBuffer': identifier not found vertexbuffers.cpp(33) : error C2065: 'GL_ARRAY_BUFFER' : undeclared identifier vertexbuffers.cpp(33) : error C2065: 'GL_STATIC_DRAW' : undeclared identifier vertexbuffers.cpp(33) : error C3861: 'glBufferData': identifier not found When I examined <GL\gl.h> (contained in C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0A\Include\gl) I saw: /* ClientArrayType */ /* GL_VERTEX_ARRAY */ /* GL_NORMAL_ARRAY */ /* GL_COLOR_ARRAY */ Update but it would seem that those contants get defined elsewhere. How am I supposed to generate buffers if I don't have access to those functions? The documentation doesn't say that those array types are disabled. How do I get access to the real implementation on OpenGL on Windows? Could you past the specific errors? It is possible that those comments are for documentation and that things are properly defined elsewhere. Yes I jumped the gun with those functions. My real errors come from the Buffer generation functions. Sorry for the confusion I have edited the question. Thanks for posting those it helped me understand and fix up my answer. :) The #defines are commented out in the header file whenever they would otherwise be repeated. Look at line 1054 of gl.h: /* vertex_array */ #define GL_VERTEX_ARRAY 0x8074 If this #define is actually missing then you should probably replace the file with a fresh copy. If you look at the documentation for glGenBuffers you will see that it is only available in OpenGL 1.5 and higher. The header file for Windows only comes with OpenGL 1.2 and you should use the extension mechanism to access the newer functionality. If you call wglGetProcAddress with the function name e.g. void (__stdcall *glGenBuffers)(GLsizeiGLuint*) = wglGetProcAddress(""glGenBuffers""); then you have a pointer to the function. You have better eyes than me. Thank you for the reference. Unfortunately I still have errors revolving around glBindBuffer. edited after i looked at the errors you were recieving. unfortunately the header is 1.2 only but there are easy fixes. :)  Microsoft's support for OpenGL stretches only as far as OpenGL-1.1 up to Windows XP and OpenGL-1.4 starting with Vista. Any OpenGL functionality beyond those must be delivered and supported by the installable client driver (ICD) i.e. the GPU driver's OpenGL implmenentation. To access the advanced functionality OpenGL provides the so called Extension System formed by wglGetProcAddress which is kind of like GetProcAddress for DLLs but gives access to functions of the OpenGL implementation (=driver). To make things easier nice wrapper libraries like GLEW have been developed which do all the grunt work initializing all the available OpenGL extensions providing them to the end user.  It would seem that the buffer functions are only available on Windows as extension methods. OpenGL provides glext.h that declares pointers to all of these functions. It is then up to my app to use wglGetProcAddress to get pointers to the functions. For example: PFNGLGENBUFFERSPROC myglBindBuffers = (PFNGLGENBUFFERSPROC)wglGetProcAddress(""glGenBuffersARB""); Thankfully I only have to do it for about 4 functions. Unfortunately I now have to add platform-dependent code to my app. +1 for the sensible way to find these type definitions - thanks!  You might give GLEW a shot: http://glew.sourceforge.net/ I'm pretty sure I used it at some time in the past and makes this sort of thing a little easier and more portable.

313916,"Custom Cursor in a Swing JDialog I have a Java Swing application developed on Mac OS X 10.5 using Java 1.5. I'm trying to make a custom cursor appear when the user moves the mouse over some text in a dialog. The cursor never changes though. When I don't use a JFrame instead of a JDialog the cursor does change. But then I'll have to write all the dialog code myself. How can I get the cursor to appear? Here's the simplest code I could create to demonstrate the problem: import javax.swing.*; import java.awt.*; public class CursorTest { public static void main(String[] args) { JLabel label = new JLabel(""Move mouse here for hand cursor""); label.setCursor(Cursor.getPredefinedCursor(Cursor.HAND_CURSOR)); JOptionPane pane = new JOptionPane(label); pane.setOptions(new Object[]{""OK""}); JDialog dialog = pane.createDialog(null ""Test Dialog""); dialog.setVisible(true); } } Looks like it is a bug in Java 1.5: I first tried with Java 1.6.0_07 and it worked as expected (on Windows XP). Then I recompiled with Java 1.5.0_06 and indeed the cursor remains in default state. Knowing the difficulties of Java 1.6 on MacOS I see it will be hard to fix that... Bug ID: 5079694 JDialog doesn't respect setCursor They give a workaround... [EDIT] Tested workaround: public class CursorTest extends JFrame { private CursorTest() { } private void ShowDialog() { JLabel label = new JLabel(""Move mouse here for hand cursor""); label.setCursor(Cursor.getPredefinedCursor(Cursor.HAND_CURSOR)); JOptionPane pane = new JOptionPane(label); pane.setOptions(new Object[] { ""OK"" } ); JDialog dialog = pane.createDialog(this ""Test Dialog""); dialog.setVisible(true); } public static void main(String[] args) { SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable() { public void run() { CursorTest testFrame = new CursorTest(); testFrame.setTitle(""Test GUI""); testFrame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE); testFrame.setSize(500 300); testFrame.setVisible(true); testFrame.ShowDialog(); } }); } } Works fine with my JDK & system.  Thanks PhiLho that Sun bug report gave me the solution. The owner (parent frame) must be non-null and showing.

The pure Python version performs almost 30x faster than Numpy. Numpy performance in other tests has been better than the Python equivalent (which was the expected result). So I've got two related questions: Can anyone explain why NumPy is performing so poorly in this case? Is there something I can do to fix it? To reduce the numpy calling overhead you might try using cython as an intermediate to call into the numpy functions. See Fast numerical computations with Cython (SciPy 2009) for details.  Excellent post! I think that the comparison is not actually fair. Batch Cross Product gives an array containing the cross products of all vectors while Python Cross Product gives one vector at a time. If you need to compute all cross products at once of course Batch is better but if you need to compute every cross product separately you should include the overhead of accessing the array. Also if a cross product if a function of the previous cross product the Batch implementation should be modified.  You can see the source code yourself here: http://www.google.com/codesearch/p?hl=en#5mAq98l-MUw/trunk/dnumpy/numpy/core/numeric.py&q=cross%20package:numpy&sa=N&cd=1&ct=rc numpy.cross just handles lots of cases and does some extra copies. In general numpy is going to be plenty fast enough for slow things like matrix multiplication or inversion - but operations on small vectors like that have a lot of overhead.  Try this with larger arrays. I think that just the cost of calling the methods of numpy here overruns the simple several list accesses required by the Python version. If you deal with larger arrays I think you'll see large wins for numpy. In this particular case 3 component arrays (xyz co-ordinates) are by far the most common case. What's also a bit weird is that even reading from numpy arrays the python code is still faster. If it was call overhead I'd expect that to be slowed down even more than the pure NumPy solution. @Adam: but by reading from numpy's arrays you save the overhead of calling the `cross` function itself which is a dynamically loaded extension so it goes through at least a couple of pointers. For such short arrays it indeed makes sense as a micro-optimization to unroll the call to `cross` I just added a test case where I batched the arrays together and saw a considerable performance boost. So I'd say the overhead theory is correct. Looks like if I want to use Numpy for a performance boost I'll need to find a way of batching these operations together.",python performance numpy,1.643272057145352E-4,0.03368380327679804,2.2906762303167202E-4,0.9659228018944558
2094247,"user activity database structure I am working on a community website. I want to show the user's activity in 2 places in the website. The User ""A"" Profile. The Friends page of the user ""A"" friends. ""What are your friends doing?"" The tables for instance are: members members_gallery members_videos members_friends my problem is in the Sql structure. I've read this question ""User recent activities - PHP MySql"" The ""union"" idea is good but I have an alternative one. I am going to make a new table called members_activity The fields: id | user_id | photo | video | friend | p_id | v_id | f_id | datetime let's say that the user has just uploaded an image. id | user_id | photo | video | friend | p_id | v_id | f_id | datetime 1 | 15 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1203 | 0 | 0 | NOW() advantages: When i make a SELECT QUERY i can easily know if it's a photo video or a friendship activity. The user can delete the 'photo activity' but keep the photo. Can notify friends of the user easily. disadvantages: Huge number of table rows? Any ideas or suggestions how the big websites deal with it? digg facebook etc. If you have a huge number of rows it is really not going to be a practical disadvantage as long as you index the table properly. At the very least I would index user_id and datetime assuming you will be selecting activity for a particular user and ordering by date. Use MySQL's EXPLAIN (<query>) to ensure your indexes are optimised for the queries you are running often. I have no idea about the INDEX functionality. Thanks i am going to search about that.  I don't see why you need the friends id. For the friends page you would first do a select for all his friends then select from activity table where user_id in (2689 etc) I would make photo and video fields a single field called type where photo and video would be values this way you can later on add more activity types I would make p_id and v_id a single column called item_id .. no need for 2 columns I would add an extra column called info where I would store other information in a json format. This is for the extra data that not all events have. For example you could have an event for adding a link to the profile ... and you could place the link there since other events don't have urls and adding a column just for this event type would be not a good solution the `f_id` is to say ""X has become friends with Y"". thanks for the other notes. well that info i see it in the extra column since there is only one event that needs this  I think you're correct that a single-table approach is best here. One disadvantage however is that it doesn't scale well--what if you want to add link or comment activity types? With this model you'd have to add another column for each of those. An approach that I've seen in Rails-land is to use a polymorphic model which would look like this: id | user_id | activity_type_id | p_id | v_id | f_id | datetime You can see that I've replaced video photo etc. with activity_type_id. Then there would be a second table called activity_types:  id | name ----+------- 1 | photo 2 | video 3 | ... Then when you create a members_activity record you can assign the appropriate activity_type_id and if you want to create new activity types later on it's relatively painless and you could SELECT a particular kind of activity with a simple JOIN e.g.: SELECT * FROM members_activity JOIN activity_types ON members_activity.activity_type_id = activity_types.id WHERE activity_types.name = 'photo'; that was good. but rather than making a new MySQL table called `activity_types` i'd just make an array. it's makes it easier and faster.

Why do you have a separate `copy_book` table? To my mind it would make more sense to have a `bookID` column on the `copy` table. Usually you only need a table like `copy_book` if there is a many-to-many relationship between books and copies which I don't believe is the case You need to inner join all the tables that you are interested in: book copy user_copy and copy_book. The SELECT statement that returns attributes on all copies held by a user may look like this: SELECT B.bookID  B.name  B.author  B.publisher  C.condition  C.comments -- you may get other fields that you are interested in here..

Here's an example. package eed3si9n.hashtabletable; import java.awt.BorderLayout; import java.util.Enumeration; import java.util.Hashtable; import javax.swing.JFrame; import javax.swing.JPanel; import javax.swing.JScrollPane; import javax.swing.JTable; import javax.swing.table.AbstractTableModel; import javax.swing.JButton; import java.awt.Dimension; public class MainForm extends JFrame { private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L; private JPanel jContentPane = null; // @jve:decl-index=0:visual-constraint=""2338"" private JScrollPane m_scrollPane = null; private JTable m_table = null; private Hashtable<String String> m_hash = null; private JButton m_btnAdd = null; /** * This is the default constructor */ public MainForm() { super(); initialize(); m_hash = new Hashtable<String String>(); m_hash.put(""Dog"" ""Bow""); } private void onButtonPressed() { m_hash.put(""Cow"" ""Moo""); m_table.revalidate(); } /** * This method initializes this * * @return void */ private void initialize() { this.setSize(409 290); this.setTitle(""JFrame""); this.setContentPane(getJContentPane()); } /** * This method initializes jContentPane * * @return javax.swing.JPanel */ private JPanel getJContentPane() { if (jContentPane == null) { jContentPane = new JPanel(); jContentPane.setLayout(new BorderLayout()); jContentPane.setSize(new Dimension(500 500)); jContentPane.setPreferredSize(new Dimension(500 500)); jContentPane.add(getM_scrollPane() BorderLayout.NORTH); jContentPane.add(getM_btnAdd() BorderLayout.SOUTH); } return jContentPane; } /** * This method initializes m_scrollPane * * @return javax.swing.JScrollPane */ private JScrollPane getM_scrollPane() { if (m_scrollPane == null) { m_scrollPane = new JScrollPane(); m_scrollPane.setViewportView(getM_table()); } return m_scrollPane; } /** * This method initializes m_table * * @return javax.swing.JTable */ private JTable getM_table() { if (m_table == null) { m_table = new JTable(); m_table.setModel(new AbstractTableModel(){ private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L; public int getColumnCount() { return 2; } public int getRowCount() { return m_hash.size(); } public String getColumnName(int column) { if (column == 0) { return ""Animal""; } else { return ""Sound""; } } public Object getValueAt(int rowIndex int columnIndex) { if (columnIndex == 0) { return getKey(rowIndex); } else { return m_hash.get(getKey(rowIndex)); } // if-else } private String getKey(int a_index) { String retval = """"; Enumeration<String> e = m_hash.keys(); for (int i = 0; i < a_index + 1; i++) { retval = e.nextElement(); } // for return retval; } }); } return m_table; } /** * This method initializes m_btnAdd * * @return javax.swing.JButton */ private JButton getM_btnAdd() { if (m_btnAdd == null) { m_btnAdd = new JButton(); m_btnAdd.setPreferredSize(new Dimension(34 30)); m_btnAdd.addActionListener(new java.awt.event.ActionListener() { public void actionPerformed(java.awt.event.ActionEvent e) { onButtonPressed(); } }); } return m_btnAdd; } public static void main(String[] args) { //Schedule a job for the event-dispatching thread: //creating and showing this application's GUI. javax.swing.SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable() { public void run() { MainForm frame = new MainForm(); frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE); frame.setSize(500 500); frame.setVisible(true); } }); } } // @jve:decl-index=0:visual-constraint=""1010""  Firstly avoid Hashtable go straight for Map. In this case there two potential standard implementations you mights want: LinkedHashMap can retain the order that the entries were added; TreeMap a SortedMap/NavigableMap will sort the results (order of which can be determined by a Comparator. Alternatively you might want a form of Map that fire events or also provides a TableModel. If you want a one time conversion from the Map to table then it's pretty straightforward. public static TableModel toTableModel(Map<??> map) { DefaultTableModel model = new DefaultTableModel( new Object[] { ""Key"" ""Value"" } 0 ); for (Map.Entry<??> entry : map) { model.addRow(new Object[] { entry.getKey() entry.getValue() }); } return model; } Then just create the JTable with this pre-populated model. (Disclaimer: I've not tested or so much as compiled this code.) To keep the Map and TableModel synchronized is more code. Generally it's best to avoid duplicating state whereever possible. Write a class that exposes itself as both a Map and a TableModel. You could go more disjoint by having a Map that fires events and a TableModel that adapts the Map (although note that Map does not have random access based on index so you'll need to be iether clever or slow for large maps). Going the other way a simpler approach would be to add the data straight to a DefaultTableModel and not using a Map at all.",java swing hashtable jtable,1.3281624641692805E-4,0.8158607915762964,0.17843850889630053,0.005567883280986123

This will not work. You will need to use something along the lines of $sql = mysql_query(""SELECT * FROM tblStudents WHERE id='"" . $pUInput[0] .

1749520,"How can I make my mysql database records visible to search engines? I am creating a classifieds website called 'mySite' and I want whoever searches for honda +mySite in google to find all ads with the description 'honda' or headline 'honda' from my database. How is this done? (a htm page for every ad? which then loads the 'ad data' when user clicks to open the htm page?) I have an example for you to look at: www.blocket.se is a swedish site where you can buy almost anything. I am guessing they dont actually have 500thousand html pages just so that google can find them right? Try searching this in google: blocket +bmw 330ci and you will see results from blocket.se database. Question is: How have they done it? and how should I do it so that I have the same functionality? Thanks If you need more input tell me and I will update! This looks very familiar-> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1748688/how-to-have-search-engines-index-database-driven-content Anyway read the responses here tell us if helps (or not). You're talking about something like when typing `tree german` it comes up with a link to a dictionary...? could someone please show me an example code? Sample code would look like the code for your search. The code that generates the search results ON YOUR SITE would be a good place to start. You want to iterate all the records of your database and generate links to all items in it. If you don't know how to do this you need to do some studying of your code and/or ask some different SPECIFIC questions on SO. I will do some studying and then post another Q if I get stuck! You don't need an actual html page for every advertisement. Most of the time there is one page that looks at the url and displays content accordingly. mysite.com/honda mysite.com/acura mysite.com/bmw All of these urls would be handled by one page. The page would use the url to find what content to display and serve just that content. Basically you're just creating a website and google does the rest @camran you may be used to doing the same thing by passing a parameter to some 'index.php' such as '?type=honda'. Galen's method isn't so different if you imagine a web server responding to any requests for mysite.com with 'website.php?url=mysite.com/honda'.  I create a sitemap that links to every category and every dynamic page that way spiders can easily navigate through every url on your site. If you do this dynamically then you can easily group by popular keywords and have a special ""grouped by keyword"" sitemap. At any rate its best to have the sitemap generated dynamically so you don't miss a single dynamic page. how about meta keywords and meta descriptions are they also generated the same way? or how would you solve that? meta's are certainly able to be generated dynamically just like any other html element. i just dont know where to start! An example would simplify things for me break things up and do it one at a time first step is to create a sitemap so 100% of your pages are linked to and are able to be spidered! Then you can move on to meta tags  You need to create links to your database pages. Right now the only way to get to your pages is to use the search on your site. Google doesn't fill out form fields. So create some links to your pages. Your pages should to be search engine friendly so  http://site.com?q=honda+civic is bad http://site.com/cars/honda/civic is good. You can rewrite urls using your framework (you are using a web application framework right?). You need to link to these pages preferably from other sites. You won't ever get every page in google because they are too similar and google will probably throw a lot of them out. But you need links to them to start. Ok. I get your explanation... but could you please post an example? You are talking about auto-adding url to a 'sitemap' but what would that url lead to? There are 2 separate issues here. 1) You don't have a sitemap so google doesn't know you have any pages. 2) Even if you did google doesn't like pages with ?q= in it So there are 2 things to fix. Sample code is way out of the scope of this question. we have no idea what framework you are using if you are using one at all. Do you know how to iterate the database and generate pages? yes i know that! I just dont get the idea of how to create links which are renamed to something else and then somehow add a meta-element to it? I will have to study some more I guess. But thanks Google URL rewriting. Check stack overflow as well. You can make URLs like /cars/honda/civic automatically go to ?q=honda+civic. Good luck! You can modify the meta tags by editing the code the displays the page. The data for the meta tag should come from the data you are displaying. OK I think I get it you are saying crawler goes in thorugh the backdoor even though the actual page to display the record 'honda civic' hasent yet been created but google will find it anyway right? just as long as there is a link there to a php page which fetches data from a mysql database? right or wrong? Url rewriting will take one (nonexistant) url and serve the data from another url (that exists). To the user/crawler it will look like the nonexistant url has the data. so even thought here is no /cars/hond/civic on your site the web server will make the end user think there is.  You need to have links to the (dynamically created) pages. Google doesn't know (or care) if the page is dynamically generated. But it's not going to find it if you don't have a link to it. The google bot doesn't just spam your search box looking for keywords (for obvious reasons). For example your homepage should link to a ""latest"" page with a list of all your latest items. You should also create an archive page for every day with links to the items that were posted that day. These index pages can be dynamically generated as long as there is a link to them from your home page. Also remember to cache your daily archives and give a long value for the EXPIRES meta-tag so you don't have to hit your database every time somebody has a look. If you want to know more google has a guide for web-masters: http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=35769 In particular look at sitemaps: http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=156184 I'm suggesting that he creates a page for every day which links to all the items posted that day. Those pages aren't going to change so they can be cached. I should have written ""cache your indexes of items posted that day"".

1350174,"What does matrix**2 mean in python/numpy? I have a python ndarray temp in some code I'm reading that suffers this: x = temp**2 Is this the dot square (ie equivalent to m.*m) or the matrix square (ie m must be a square matrix)? In particular I'd like to know whether I can get rid of the transpose in this code: temp = num.transpose(whatever) num.sum(temp**2axis=1)) and turn it into this: num.sum(whatever**2axis=0) That will save me at least 0.1ms and is clearly worth my time. Thanks! The ** operator is ungooglable and I know nothing! a ** is the raise-to-power operator in Python so x**2 means ""x squared"" in Python -- including numpy. Such operations in numpy always apply element by element so x**2 squares each element of array x (whatever number of dimensions) just like say x*2 would double each element or x+2 would increment each element by two (in each case x proper is unaffected -- the result is a new temporary array of the same shape as x!). Edit: as @kaizer.ze points out while what I wrote holds for numpy.array objects it doesn't apply to numpy.matrix objects where multiplication means matrix multiplication rather than element by element operation like for array (and similarly for raising to power) -- indeed that's the key difference between the two types. As the Scipy tutorial puts it for example: When we use numpy.array or numpy.matrix there is a difference. A*x will be in the latter case matrix product not elementwise product as with array. i.e. as the numpy reference puts it: A matrix is a specialized 2-d array that retains its 2-d nature through operations. It has certain special operators such as * (matrix multiplication) and ** (matrix power). Well it is sadly not so simple as I answered; the differing behaviors of `array` and `matrix` can confuse this and operators such as `*` and `**` change meaning! (If A * B is matrix multiplication whith A B matrix A**2 has to be matrix exponentiation of course.) Yes there's a difference between matrix and array -- though `**` is of course still the raise-to-power operation operations on a matrix apply to ""the matrix"" on an array to ""the elements"". Good point let me edit to clarify.  You should read NumPy for Matlab Users. The elementwise power operation is mentioned there and you can also see that in numpy some operators apply differently to array and matrix. >>> from numpy import * >>> a = arange(4).reshape((22)) >>> print a**2 [[0 1] [4 9]] >>> print matrix(a)**2 [[ 2 3] [ 6 11]]  It's just the square of each element. from numpy import * a = arange(4).reshape((22)) print a**2 prints [[0 1] [4 9]] Woot thanks. Fifteeeeenherewecome. You're welcome. (I signed back into point out the probably obvious note that if you're ndarray are >2 dimensions I don't think the transposing axis swapping thing will work.) I can see where this might be confusing. Without knowing Python and understanding that for real (and complex) numbers squaring means ""multiply a number by itself"" it would have been reasonable to assume that it meant ""multiply a matrix by itself"" for matricies. This means that the matrix has equal numbers of rows and columns of course.",python numpy,2.9401307059578424E-4,4.79480539970022E-4,4.0984616593929145E-4,0.9988166602234948
